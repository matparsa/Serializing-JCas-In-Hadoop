<LEADPARA>  THERE'LL be something rather astonishing on "60 Minutes" this Sunday night.
You'll see the Grand Inquisitor Mike Wallace make the Grand Funny Lady of
cinema cry. Wallace has known Barbra Streisand since he interviewed her in the
'60s, so on the CBS show, they go down memory lane together, parry and thrust
-- right up to the present. The present, of course, includes promotion for
Streisand's current CD musical retrospective and her soon due self-directed
movie "The Prince of Tides." (Streisand is famously private -- so her openness
here is somewhat startling.);   Wallace admits he didn't like Streisand when
he first met her. She admits to thinking he was "mean." They both seem to come
away from this emotional encounter feeling differently about each other.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     P.S. Wallace is obviously proud of his Streisand interview. He even talks
to "Entertainment Tonight" about it this evening. He says, "I think we
captured the essence of Streisand." But though he speaks of his "immense
respect for her," he also clues us in that there is nothing new under
Streisand's sun: "She tried to control the whole thing all the way . . . she
changed the lighting . . . no bones about it.";   THE SECOND SCARLETT: All
that fuss about the new sequel to "Gone With the Wind," titled "Scarlett" --
let's say the best thing Number Two has going for it is that it has sent
thousands of Americans back to read Number One. "Gone With the Wind" itself
has been on the best-seller list again as a result. Margaret Mitchell's great
novel of the Civil War deserves everything, but I'm not sure it deserves
"Scarlett.";   However, this sequel will be made into a big TV movie, as you
know. So here is a wonderful suggestion from one of my readers, who says: "How
about Delta Burke (minus 30 pounds) -- she is dead ringer for Vivien Leigh and
about the age Scarlett would be when the story picks up. She has the same
beauty, the same impish expression, and the same intelligence Scarlett would
have. I think she could pull it off!";   I think so, too. No one can "be" like
Vivien Leigh, but Burke is the best idea yet. Is anybody listening out there
in TV land?;   THAT'S THE SPIRIT: Columbia Pictures has just purchased the
film rights to Norman Mailer's smash hit, the massive CIA novel "Harlot's
Ghost." Zoetrope Films and director Francis Ford Coppola will do the honors!; 
 BELOW THE SURFACE: Leona Helmsley has acquired a reputation that would give
ancient Rome's immortal bad woman Messalina pause. She has battled mightily to
reverse this image. And she's still trying. Recently Helmsley contacted Visual
AIDS, a group of artists committed to the AIDS fight, to say that on Dec. 1,
World AIDS Day, all Helmsley-owned buildings will go dark for 15 minutes --
including New York City landmark the Empire State Building. (Many New York
buildings and bridges will turn off their floodlights for this "Night Without
Light.") Helmsley also asked for 6,000 red ribbons from the Ribbon Project for
her employees to wear on Dec. 1. They signify support and compassion for
people with AIDS.  </TEXT>
