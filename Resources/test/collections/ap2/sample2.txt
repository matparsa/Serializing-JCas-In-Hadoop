   New York investor Donald Trump may
seek up to 24.9 percent of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal
Studios, the entertainment conglomerate said Friday.
   It has been speculated for more than a year that MCA would be a
takeover target, but until now no suitor has emerged.
   Some analysts have long contended the company's stock was
undervalued. But it was believed a hostile takeover would be
difficult because MCA is ruled with an iron hand by Lew Wasserman,
the last of the old-line movie moguls.
   Wasserman, 74, has been with MCA and its forerunner, Music Corp.
of America, since 1936.
   In a brief announcement, MCA said it had been notified by Trump
that he owns 375,000 of the company's shares and may seek to
acquire 24.9 percent.
   MCA has 77.1 million shares outstanding.
   MCA's announcement came after the stock market closed, but the
company's stock already had jumped by $5.25 per share to $45 on
rumors that a takeover bid was in the offing.
   Like most other companies, MCA's shares took a beating in the
stock market crash and never fully recovered. In the past year,
their highest price was $64.50.
   Trump spokeswoman Norma Foerderer in New York said she had no
comment.
   MCA takeover speculation peaked in mid-1987 when Wasserman was
hospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have been
routine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon.
   However, Wasserman did return to the helm of the entertainment
giant after five weeks, reportedly with his corporate power
undiminished.
   To dissaude suitors, MCA last July adopted a ``poison-pill''
permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if a
hostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of MCA or made an
unsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent.
   Wasserman's control comes more from the respect he commands than
from the stock he controls.
   Wasserman owns 6.9 percent of MCA's stock and controls another
8.9 percent through a series of trusts, including those of the
family of MCA founder Jules Stein.
   From its beginning as a Hollywood talent-booking agency, MCA has
grown into a powerhouse in producing movies, television
programming, records and toys.
   It operates a successful backlot tour of Universal Studios here,
is building one in Florida and has agreed to build one in Japan. In
all three locations, it would be competing with theme parks by its
arch-rival Walt Disney Co.
   MCA also is involved in book publishing, retail and mail-order
businesses.
   In 1987, MCA earned $137.9 million, or $1.97 per share, a
decrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted $150.9
million, or $1.97 per share.
   The decline would have been even more dramatic except that the
1986 results already were depressed by a $50 million writeoff to
cover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent television
stations that had used MCA programs.
   Trump, who made his fortune in New York real estate, is building
a casino empire with two hotel-gaming houses already in Atlantic
City, N.J., and a permit pending for a third one.
   Trump also is seeking to gain total control of Atlantic
City-based Resorts International Inc. He already owns 90 percent of
the company's voting power.
   In addition, Trump in the past has acquired stakes in takeover
targets and later sold them for a handsome profit.

   Vice President George Bush holds a 2-1
lead over chief rival Sen. Bob Dole in the 14 Southern and border
states that hold primaries on March 8, Super Tuesday, a poll
indicated Monday.
   On the Democratic side, Jesse Jackson and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis were running roughly even in the South, the Scripps
Howard News Service survey suggested.
   Dukakis was the nationwide favorite among Democrats, according
to another poll, this one by CBS News and The New York Times.
According to that survey, Dukakis had 21 percent; Jackson 13
percent; Rep. Richard Gephardt had 12 percent and former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart 10 percent.
   Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were the leaders in
the Southern and border Super Tuesday states, garnering 19 percent
and 16 percent respectively, the CBS-New York Times poll said.
Dukakis had 13 percent; Gephardt 11 percent and Hart 10 percent,
the CBS-Times poll indicated.
   In the Scripps Howard survey, Bush led Dole by a 51-26 margin,
with former television evangelist Pat Robertson was third with 11
percent. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York trailed with 3 percent and 9
percent were undecided, the poll indicated.
   In the CBS-New York Times poll of Super Tuesday states plus
South Carolina, findings were similar: 51 percent for Bush to 20
percent for Dole. In the nationwide sampling the survey found 42
percent opting for Bush and 27 percent for Dole.
   The Scripps Howard pollsters contacted 423 likely Republican
voters Feb. 17-19, just after New Hampshire's Feb. 16 primary. The
margin of error on the GOP side was 5 percentage points, the news
service said.
   Bush won the New Hampshire primary, eight days after a bruising
third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses behind Dole and Robertson.
   Among Democrats, the Scripps Howard survey gave Jackson 22
percent and Dukakis 19 percent _ within the poll's 4
percentage-point margin of error. Dukakis was the decisive winner
of the New Hampshire primary.
   Gore, who has pinned his hopes on a strong showing in the South,
and Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who won the Iowa caucuses
and placed second in New Hampshire, each had 14 percent, and 21
percent were undecided, the news service said.
   Hart had 6 percent, the Scripps Howard poll indicated, and Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois drew the backing of 5 percent. On the
Democratic side, 597 voters were surveyed during the same time
period as the Republican polling.
   The Scripps Howard survey involved voters in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia,
all of which hold primaries or caucuses on March 8. Six other
states hold primaries or caucuses that day as well.
   The Scripps Howard survey was done in conjunction with the
Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald, The Commercial Appeal of Memphia and
The Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel.
   The telephone poll of 2,734 adults nationwide for CBS and the
Times was taken Feb. 17-21 has a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points on the Democratic side and four points for
the GOP race.
   The CBS-Times Super Tuesday figures have a margin of error of
four percentage points for the Democrats and five points for the
Republicans.
