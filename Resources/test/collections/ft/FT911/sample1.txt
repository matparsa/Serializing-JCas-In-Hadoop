RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, and SNIA
Fibre, a unit of Fiat's SNIA offshoot, plan to merge their European
activities in polyamide carpet yarn (BCF) and polyamide staple fibre, Reuter
reports.
Rhone-Poulenc said the merged unit, held 50-50 by itself and SNIA, will have
estimated annual turnover of FFr1.8bn (Dollars 322.8m) and employ about
1,500 people.
The joint venture will be Europe's largest carpet staple fibre and BCF
polyamide producer. It will be a leading producer of polyamide staple fibre
for textile and industrial uses.
Mediobanca yesterday revealed that gross profit fell to L340.4bn (Dollars
274.7m) in the first half, from L354.7bn in the previous year.
But in the eight months to the end of February this year, gross profit stood
at L409.8bn, slightly up from L407.9bn in the same period the year before,
the bank said.
