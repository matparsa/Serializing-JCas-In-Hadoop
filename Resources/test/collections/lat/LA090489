RESTRICTIONS KEEP MIGRANT HOUSING FUNDS IN LIMBO 
</P>

Half a million dollars sits in a bank account in Sacramento, just waiting to be 
used on desperately needed housing for migrant farm workers in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
And it will continue to sit, as long as a formidable wall of regulations 
separates the money from the people who need it. 
</P>
<P>
The money, as approved in the state budget two months ago, comes with 
restrictions that critics say are utterly impractical. 
</P>
<P>
"That program has so many strings attached to it that it's virtually useless 
for San Diego County," said Oceanside Housing Director Richard Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), the driving force behind the budget 
item, was thrilled last July when Gov. George Deukmejian approved the spending 
blueprint with the $500,000 allotment intact. Frazee remarked at the time that 
it was "nice to win one" after seeing a similar proposal jettisoned last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, early applause for the success of the budget appropriation has given 
way to grumbling by agencies eager to provide housing, but who have discovered 
their plans do not qualify under the state's restrictions on use of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restrictions that make the money difficult to obtain are provisions 
that the funds be used only for permanent structures, which must be built on 
land that is either owned or leased for a minimum of 20 years by the city or 
agency proposing to construct the housing. Also, the housing is for families 
only and is not to be used year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee's staff is back at the drawing board, reviving an Assembly bill to make 
the money more accessible. Frazee reportedly is trying to push the bill through 
the Legislature in the two weeks remaining before the session ends Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Doesn't Qualify 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside, host to an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 migrant laborers each year, has 
a plan for farm worker housing but is ineligible to use the state money, which 
will be disbursed by the state Office of Migrant Services via the Farmworker 
Housing Grant Program. The project would involve leasing trailers directly to 
the farmers to provide shelter for the year-round work force. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been talking with the growers, and we know they are ready, willing and 
able to join us in doing this," Goodman said. "The money has been appropriated, 
and the need is outrageous. But the state has got so many strings on that money 
we can't use it." 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in Sacramento, Goodman said state officials appeared unaware 
that the agricultural areas of San Diego County operate under completely 
different circumstances than the rural farms in California's Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep saying, 'Get some land,' but property here is too valuable and too 
scarce for us to just go out and buy some," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, in a place like Oceanside, the farmland is around where all the 
well-heeled people live," he said. "Getting a high-density apartment complex 
for migrant workers approved would be a political nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
The amended bill would make the money usable for temporary housing for single 
farm workers on a year-round basis and would also seek to set aside $100,000 
for use on a project similar to the one proposed by Oceanside. Though the 
$100,000 would technically be available to any agency with a plan to house 
migrant workers, "for all practical purposes, Oceanside is the only game in 
town unless someone else really moves fast," Frazee's chief of staff, Richard 
Ledford, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portables for Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside plans to purchase portable trailers, then lease them to the growers 
at a nominal rate, probably $1 a year, Goodman said. The growers would be 
responsible for installing water and power lines to the trailers and 
maintaining the units, which would house up to seven people each. The growers 
would have to invest $5,000 to $10,000 for each trailer, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee's bill, AB-617, was already in the works while the budget was being 
hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt 617 was on track," Ledford said. "But our negotiations with the 
administration came out a little more positive than we thought they would. 
Rather than wait for Jan. 1 for the new legislation to take effect, Frazee made 
a decision to see if we could get it in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined we would have the problems with it that we did. In 
retrospect, I wish we had been a little more specific about how the money could 
be spent." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the legislation has been resurrected as a "trailer" bill, intended to 
clean up the details left out by the $500,000 budget appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, AB-617 had successfully cleared the Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee and was being considered on the floor of the state Senate, carried by 
Sen. William Craven, (R-Oceanside), according to Ledford. 
</P>
<P>
The current program does allow for the housing to be built on land in which the 
city has a 20-year "controlling interest," but Goodman said even that provision 
would not be sufficient. "There's no grower that's going to commit his property 
for that long in the future," he said, in light of the rapid pace at which 
farmland is being sold to developers in the North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Their rules and regulations just don't mesh with reality in Southern 
California, especially San Diego County," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Called 'Flexible' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vangundi, state deputy director of housing, defended the state's stance, 
saying the Farmworker Housing Grant Program is "a very flexible program." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the funds are there," he said. "They are for use for farm-worker 
family housing in San Diego, and that's what it will be used for." But the 
local officials who are desirous of using that money have to "reformat their 
thinking," Vangundi said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they wanted to focus on as a solution wasn't going to work," he said, 
referring to Oceanside's trailer plan. The state would balk at allowing the 
trailers to be put on the farmers' property, he said. "We're the lender of the 
taxpayers' money . . . and the taxpayers are not going to be happy about 
putting money on a private landowner's land, if he can turn that site over to 
some other use next year." 
</P>
<P>
"They will need to have that land or long-term control of that land," Vangundi 
said. "That is definitely a major string, but it's one that they are going to 
have to come to grips with." 
</P>
<P>
Vangundi suggested that Oceanside approach Camp Pendleton about obtaining a 
long-term lease for farm-worker housing on the Marine base. The problem of 
farmland being sold to developers was also not insurmountable, he said. "If 
some of that agricultural land converts to residential down the road, it 
doesn't preclude them from still having farm-worker housing there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Purchases OK 
</P>
<P>
Vangundi pointed out that the money may also be used for things besides 
construction, such as site acquisition, feasibility studies and environmental 
reviews, or as a down payment for federal grant programs that require matching 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the way it was written by the legislative staffers, the thing kind 
of got a little bit garbled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional misunderstandings may have occurred because the state defines 
"migrant workers" as laborers who migrate from crop to crop, not as migrants 
from Mexico or other countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent difficulties, Vangundi said, "We're not giving up. There's 
going to be a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials, unconvinced that the state is on their side, are now relying 
on Frazee's efforts to help them obtain the money. 
</P>
<P>
Though Oceanside appears to be the front-runner for state funding, other social 
service agencies in North County are moving ahead with plans to build housing 
for farm workers with or without the state money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valley Center Site Possible 
</P>
<P>
Amy Rowland, director of the North County Housing Foundation, said her 
nonprofit organization has been working on plans to establish farm-worker 
housing in Valley Center or in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Center plan, however, has stalled because of the difficulty of 
finding an appropriate site, she said. Most of Valley Center is under a 
county-mandated building moratorium because the high ground-water level has led 
to problems with the septic systems. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to find a site yet, but no matter where we build, it's 
going to be used," she said. "There's enough need out there to do hundreds of 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland said she is considering the state money as one possible source for 
financing the Valley Center project but has not been encouraged by reports of 
the inaccessibility of the money. "It looks like the way that funding is 
allocated currently it would be tough to use in San Diego in any way that would 
make sense," she said. "I think whoever uses the money, it's going to have to 
be coupled with other resources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Project Planned 
</P>
<P>
The North County Chaplaincy is also moving ahead on a housing project in the 
Encinitas area and probably will apply for a share of the state money, 
spokeswoman Millie Gordon said. "We've got everything taken care of," Gordon 
said. "We're just now going insane trying to find funding." 
</P>
<P>
The Chaplaincy project will utilize prefabricated units that will house eight 
people each, and arrangements already have been made to lease land and provide 
utilities and social services, Gordon said. The housing will be open to farm 
workers, immigrants and the general homeless population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is money," Gordon said. "With $250,000, we could set up 20 
families, up to 100 individuals, in their own homes within a month." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Rodriguez, county housing department chief, said the county supports 
the nonprofit agencies in their quest for the state funds. The county itself 
does not have any proposals to build farm-worker housing, he said.
