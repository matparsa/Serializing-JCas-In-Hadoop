SHAVING CREAM WAR: A JOKE, RIGHT?; 
</P>
<P>
WHY THE BANNING OF 16 ITEMS IS A SMOG-BUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the late Sen. Everett Dirksen once said of the federal budget, a billion 
dollars here and a billion dollars there and pretty soon you are talking real 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of smog. So the state Air Resources Board took aim last week 
at 16 liquids or lotions you can find in almost any house. With these 16 
products, California's 30 million people pump as much pollution-breeding 
chemical waste into the air every day as 20 big oil refineries or 60 small 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
SMOG PROMOTERS: Consider a common sight in California as the morning rush hour 
unfolds. A car backs out of a driveway, jets of water spraying its windshield, 
its wipers flicking away the night's accumulation of dust and grime. By the 
time that car reaches the street, it has a clean windshield, the better to see 
and avoid other cars, pedestrians, cats, garbage trucks and the like -- and 
that's good. 
</P>
<P>
What's bad, as the Air Board said last week, is that the air is now a little 
bit dirtier. Windshield-washer fluids that drivers mix with water to help the 
wiper blades brush away bugs and other debris is known in the multisyllabic 
language of air-pollution control as a "volatile organic compound." This is 
another way of saying hydrocarbon, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon that on the 
average sunny day in Southern California mixes with oxides of nitrogen to 
create smog. 
</P>
<P>
Washing a single windshield is one thing. But there are 15 million cars in 
California. A squirt here and a squirt there and pretty soon you are talking 
real smog. 
</P>
<P>
The air board is not reaching in to snatch hair spray and aerosol shaving 
creams out of bathroom cabinets. Californians will still be able to buy 
furniture and floor polish, bug spray, kitchen cleaners and other items among 
the 16 formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The important changes will be made at the factories that produce these items, 
compelling them to do so with formulas that reduce the amount of hydrocarbons 
set loose every time the cap comes off a bottle or a spray-button is pushed. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will spend anywhere from $16,000 to $500,000 a year more to 
produce the reformulated goods. They probably will cost consumers between a 
penny and a quarter more. 
</P>
<P>
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PAYOFF: What will that buy in terms of clean air? About 45 
fewer tons each day of hydrocarbons, according to the Air Board. Getting 
reductions of that magnitude out of major oil refineries in California would 
mean shutting down 10 of the big ones. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the Air Board in Sacramento, which will require changes in six of 
the products by 1993 and the rest by 1994, is part of a new phase of pollution 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The big, and relatively easy, targets like power plants, refineries and fleets 
of automobiles are now covered. Future gains on smog will involve tightening up 
on thousands or millions of small sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Board is absolutely on the right track. Our guess is that Californians 
may not notice these incremental changes for years -- when they take deep 
breaths or realize that they can actually see the mountains near home.
