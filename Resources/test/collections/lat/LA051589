LEBANON HOSTAGE SURFACES

A West German relief worker surfaced in Lebanon after his abduction 10 days 
earlier. Markus Quint offered few clues about his disappearance when he spoke 
with reporters in the southern city of Zahrani, headquarters of the 
ASME-Humanitas relief group for which he works. He appeared with Nabih Berri, 
head of the Shiite Muslim militia Amal, who said his organization obtained 
Quint's release without paying a ransom. He did not name the kidnapers but said 
"we exerted a lot of pressure and carried out raids." Meanwhile, Syrian forces 
joined the search for an elderly Briton, Jack Mann, who disappeared last week. 
A group calling itself the Cells of Armed Struggle claimed Friday that it had 
taken a hostage, but it did not provide an identification.

A stock clerk who was believed to be among the hostages held by a gunman at a K 
mart store in San Leandro was arrested for investigation of stealing electronic 
equipment from the store, police said. Darnell Marshall Oliver, 28, was 
arrested after police went to his apartment in their investigation of the 
hostage drama and found several items -- including a video camera and a 
telephone answering machine -- with serial numbers of goods stolen from the K 
mart, said Lt. Tom Hull. A masked gunman hid in the store, shot one employee 
and tied and gagged the manager before police arrived and foiled the robbery 
attempt. The gunman fled and is still at large, police said.
