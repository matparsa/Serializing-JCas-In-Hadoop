   A federal grand jury here charged three former executives of Midwestern Cos. and a former executive of one of its units with tax and securities fraud. 

   The indictments, filed in U.S. district court here, charge Thomas W. Tierney, Ronald R. Walker, Carl E. Wright and Kenneth D. Sinks Jr. with as many as 20 counts each of tax and securities fraud. 
In addition, Mr. Tierney was charged with two counts of illegal trading on inside information. 

   Midwestern, based in Joplin, Mo., built ethanol plants, which it mostly sold to limited partnerships. 
The indictment alleges, among other things, that the former executives conspired to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by overvaluing 23 plants by $62 million and taking more than $13 million in deductions and tax credits that they didn't deserve. 

   In addition, the indictment charges that the defendants filed statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission that misrepresented the financial condition of the company. 
In May 1984, Midwestern and two units filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, generating investor losses of more than $50 million, the indictment alleges. 
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it develops a plan to pay off its debt. 

   An attorney for Mr. Walker, formerly president and a director of Midwestern, said his client pleaded guilty to four counts yesterday, and will testify at the trial. 
Attorneys for Mr. Tierney and Mr. Wright, who also were officers and directors of the company, said their clients will plead not guilty. 
Mr. Sinks couldn't be reached for comment.
