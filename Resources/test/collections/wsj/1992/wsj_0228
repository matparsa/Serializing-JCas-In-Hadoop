   FRANKFURT -- Two months after European leaders agreed to
adopt a common currency by the end of the decade, many
Germans are far from reconciled with the idea of giving up
the mark.
   In fact, recent opinion polls suggest that an increasing
number of Germans are upset about the plan to replace the
mark with a pan-European currency. Worried members of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party concede
that they have a lot of convincing to do.

   "The big response from corner bars of Germany since the
signing of the Maastricht treaty shows that a substantial
information effort is needed on the basis of European
monetary union," said Michael Glos, deputy chairman of the
Christian Democratic and Christian Social parliamentary
group. "Fears in the population have to be overcome, and it
has to be made clear that the deutschemark isn't being given
away but transformed into an equally firm European currency."
   The poll results demonstrate why the government is
concerned. In December, Allensbach Institute found that 49%
of 2,107 people polled nationwide objected to the mark being
replaced by a European currency. Only 26% were for it, 14%
didn't care, and 11% weren't sure. In mid-February the
Election Research Group, a Mannheim, Germany, polling group,
found that 68% of 1,021 people polled didn't think it was a
good idea to replace the mark, 28% supported the single
currency, and 4% were undecided.
   Last week, the Wickert Institute in Tuebingen, Germany,
found that 80% of 3,284 people polled knew what the European
currency unit was. But of that majority, 72% were against
plans to introduce the ECU in place of the mark. Asked if in
the 1994 national election they would vote for a political
party they don't normally support if it opposed monetary
union, 29% said yes.
   For many Germans, the European summit in the Dutch city of
Maastricht finally brought home the unsettling fact that the
plan for a single European currency isn't some distant goal.
A year ago, when monetary union was still more of a
theoretical concept, most Germans seemed generally supportive
of the notion, although their immediate attention was focused
on Germany's difficult unification.
   Now, even leading industry and banking groups are urging
Bonn against rushing currency union to meet the 1999
deadline.
   Gerhard Schmid, a Social Democrat and member of the
European Parliament, suggests that for many Germans, the mark
is not only a currency but a symbol of the nation's rebirth
after the militarist nationalism of the Third Reich. "The
German identity since World War II was focused on the
successful social market economy and its symbol, the hard
D-mark," Mr. Schmid said. "So naturally there is a big
psychological problem coping with the idea that this is all
going to be abandoned."
   Officials from both government and opposition parties say
the increasing public concerns about a single European
currency don't yet seriously endanger ratification of the
Maastricht accord by Germany's Bundestag this year. Under the
plan, all 12 European Community parliaments must ratify the
accord by next year.
   But now German officials are beginning to demand bigger
steps toward political union by some of their fellow EC
members and are likely to use flagging German enthusiasm as
leverage. For example, Chancellor Kohl could argue that
placing the future European central bank in Frankfurt would
go far toward allaying domestic pressure on the German
government.
   Chancellor Kohl also could try to convince other EC
leaders that he can't sell the project at home without
concessions from them on political union. Mr. Kohl's effort
to give more power to the European Parliament and greater
control over social policies to contain costs was blocked at
Maastricht.
   The opposition Social Democrats, who assailed Mr. Kohl for
giving in on political union in Maastricht, are pushing for
more democratic controls on the EC Council of Ministers by
giving more legislative powers to the European Parliament.
"The {German} government parties will vote for ratification
with no ifs, ands or buts," said the SPD's Mr. Schmid. "But
we want improvements to the treaty."
   If nothing else, the Bonn government has its work cut out
to prevent the currency debate from escalating into a
domestic election issue in 1994. Already, political
cartoonists and humorists lampoon Mr. Kohl as a would-be
Bismarck who signed away the mark to enter history books as
the unifier of both Germany and Europe.
   It may be late, but the German government is gearing up a
15 million mark ($9 million) information campaign promoting
currency union and European integration in German newspaper
advertisements and brochures.

   MADRID, Spain -- Two months after Spain further
deregulated its stock exchange, brokerage firms are
undergoing sweeping changes that may alter the way the market
operates in the future.
   Since the first of the year, big banks such as Banco
Espanol de Credito of Spain, Amro Bank of the Netherlands,
Credit Lyonnais S.A. of France and the Spanish unit of J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co. of the U.S. have taken majority stakes in
Spanish brokerage firms. A half dozen other brokerage firms
have disappeared, or are about to, through mergers, group
restructurings or closure.

   Now questions are being raised about the future of other
small and midsized brokerage firms that lack the market
volume and financial muscle to survive growing competition.
Many have already begun to trim staff and cut costs.
   "The panorama of the market is changing very rapidly,"
says Rafael Sarandeses, general manager of Madrid brokerage
firm Iberagentes. Credit Lyonnais recently raised its stake
in Iberagentes to 50% from 40%.
   Fernando Orteso, head of equities at Capital Markets
Equities S.A., says that "every day the big brokerages are
getting bigger and the smaller ones are getting smaller."
Amro Bank this year raised its stake in Capital Markets to
95% from 20%, and boosted the firm's capital tenfold to 1.5
billion pesetas (about $14.5 million).
   Spain's agentes de cambio, the traditional stock brokers
responsible for notarizing all security transactions,
gradually have been phased out of the market since the start
of deregulation in July 1989. Under the 1989 reform, the
agentes de cambio were given the choice of joining together
to form brokerage firms in which they collectively own at
least 70% of the capital or losing their stock brokering
rights. This shareholding requirement was reduced to 60% in
1990 and 50% in 1991. On Jan. 1, the restriction was lifted
altogether and banks, financial institutions and other
individuals are now free to own brokerage firms.
   Because the financial capacity of the agentes de cambio as
individuals is limited, a growing number have agreed to sell
their stakes to more powerful partners, normally to banks
that had been waiting eagerly for the Jan. 1 deadline.
   This year, J.P. Morgan Espana acquired all of the
brokerage firm J.P. Morgan SVB, while Banco Espanol de
Credito, or Banesto, bought out the two stock brokers that
were its partners in Banesto, Lombardia-Lacaci SVB.
   "Until now it's been an artificial situation," says Edward
Nicholson, general manager of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's
business in Spain. He says it's only natural that foreigners
and banks want to control and finance their operations.
Barclays, a unit of Barclays Bank PLC, currently owns 50% of
the brokerage firm Barclays, Pizarro &amp; Recoder SVB. "But that
stake will increase," Mr. Nicholson says.
   As they gain financial strength, many brokerage firms have
requested to change their status from brokers, with a minimum
capital requirement of 150 million pesetas, to market-makers,
with a minimum requirement of 750 million pesetas, according
to the National Stock Exchange Commission. In Spain, brokers
can trade only on behalf of third parties, while
market-makers can also trade on their own account. The new
market-makers should help inject more liquidity into the
narrow Madrid Stock Exchange.
   Other big brokerage firms such as FG Inversiones
Bursatiles and Asesores Bursatiles plan to remain
independent, though FG says it may consider selling a
minority stake to a financial partner. Executives at Asesores
Bursatiles, 30%-owned by American International Group Inc.,
are expected to increase their shareholdings in the firm.
   Rather than sell out to a bank or a foreign giant, two
firms in Valencia, Cano, Piquer &amp; Samper SVB and General de
Mediacion &amp; Bolsa SVB, announced this month that they plan to
merge. A rash of similar alliances are expected to follow.
   The independent brokerage firms believe they can thrive
without a bank or foreign partner through offering
specialized and quality service. Reforms aimed at
streamlining the stock market's settlement system also will
enable small firms to offer services traditionally reserved
for banks. These changes, which include introducing an
electronic book-entry system, go into effect later this year.
   Also liberalized on Jan. 1 were brokers' commissions. The
move is expected to narrow operating margins through lower
fees and greater competition. As some brokerage firms get
bigger and push for more market share, the less-specialized
smaller firms may be edged out of the market. Many brokers
expect the number of stock exchange members to fall to fewer
than 25 from the 54 that existed on Jan. 1. (Then, there were
134 firms trading on the market, though 80 weren't exchange
members.)
   The fear, however, is that some brokerage firms may go too
far trying to undercut competitors. "There are going to be
many houses taking somewhat suicidal routes to survive," says
an executive at a Madrid firm.
   One case in which this may have happened is Ibercorp SVB.
Founded by former stock market President Manuel de la Concha,
Ibercorp was one of the first financial boutiques to enter
the Spanish market. Thanks to the reputation of its founders,
the firm was entrusted with the investment portfolios of
leading public figures, including Bank of Spain Governor
Mariano Rubio.
   Last week, the National Stock Exchange Commission
announced it will sanction Ibercorp for failing to cooperate
with an earlier inquiry into the firm's share dealings. The
investigation was reopened by the commission last week after
the Spanish news media reported new allegations of irregular
share operations.
   Now the whole Ibercorp group, including the brokerage
firm, is up for sale. Unlike other brokerage firms, however,
Ibercorp doesn't appear to have suitors.
