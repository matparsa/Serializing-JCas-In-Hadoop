Argumentative:1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
Argumentative:1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
Argumentative:1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
Argumentative:2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
Argumentative:And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
Argumentative:2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
Argumentative:2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
Argumentative:2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
Argumentative:2:10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
Argumentative:2:12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
Argumentative:I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.
Argumentative:I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
Argumentative:2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
Argumentative:2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
Argumentative:He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
Argumentative:2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.
Argumentative:2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.
Argumentative:2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
Argumentative:2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
Argumentative:2:29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
Argumentative:3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
Argumentative:3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
Argumentative:3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
Argumentative:Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
Argumentative:3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.
Argumentative:He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
Argumentative:3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
Argumentative:3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
Argumentative:3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
Argumentative:3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
Argumentative:3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
Argumentative:3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
Argumentative:3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
Argumentative:3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
Argumentative:And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
Argumentative:4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
Argumentative:4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
Argumentative:4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
Argumentative:If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
Argumentative:4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
Argumentative:4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
Argumentative:4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
Argumentative:He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
Argumentative:5:1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
Argumentative:5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
Argumentative:And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
Argumentative:5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
Argumentative:5:11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
Argumentative:5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 5:15 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
Argumentative:5:16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
Argumentative:5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.
Argumentative:5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

Argumentative:1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

Argumentative:This is Atreides, wide-ruling Agamemnon, one that is both a goodly king and mighty spearman.
Argumentative:Homer - The Iliad - Ancinet-Mythology.com Homer - The Iliad Book III How Menelaos and Paris fought in single combat; and Aphrodite rescued Paris.
Argumentative:Now when they were arrayed, each company with their captains, the Trojans marched with clamour and with shouting like unto birds, even as when there goeth up before heaven a clamour of cranes which flee from the coming of winter and sudden rain, and fly with clamour towards the streams of ocean, bearing slaughter and fate to the Pigmy men, and in early morn offer cruel battle.
Argumentative:But on the other side marched the Achaians in silence breathing courage, eager at heart to give succour man to man.
Argumentative:Even as when the south wind sheddeth mist over the crests of a mountain, mist unwelcome to the shepherd, but to the robber better than night, and a man can see no further than he casteth a stone; even so thick arose the gathering dust-clouds at their tread as they went; and with all speed they advanced across the plain.
Argumentative:So when they were now come nigh in onset on each other, godlike Alexandros played champion to the Trojans, wearing upon his shoulders panther-skin and curved bow and sword; and he brandished two bronze-headed spears and challenged all the chieftains of the Argives to fight him man to man in deadly combat.
Argumentative:But when Menelaos dear to Ares marked him coming in the forefront of the multitude with long strides, then even as a lion is glad when he lighteth upon a great carcase, a horned stag, or a wild goat that he hath found, being an hungered; and so he devoureth it amain, even though the fleet hounds and lusty youths set upon him; even thus was Menelaos glad when his eyes beheld godlike Alexandros; for he thought to take vengeance upon the sinner.
Argumentative:So straightway he leap in his armour from his chariot to the ground.
Argumentative:But when godlike Alexandros marked him appear amid the champions, his heart was smitten, and he shrank back into the host of his comrades, avoiding death.
Argumentative:And even as a man that hath seen a serpent in a mountain glade starteth backward and trembling seizeth his feet beneath him, and he retreateth back again, and paleness hath hold of his cheeks, even so did godlike Alexandros for fear of Atreus' son shrink back into the throng of lordly Trojans.
Argumentative:Yea, that were my desire, and it were far better than thus to be our shame and looked at askance of all men.
Argumentative:I ween that the flowing-haired Achaians laugh, deeming that a prince is our champion only because a goodly favour is his; but in his heart is there no strength nor any courage.
Argumentative:And canst thou not indeed abide Menelaos dear to Ares?
Argumentative:Thy lyre will not avail thee nor the gifts of Aphrodite, those thy locks and fair favour, when thou grovellest in the dust.
Argumentative:And godlike Alexandros made answer to him again: "Hector, since in measure thou chidest me and not beyond measure - they heart is ever keen, even as an axe that pierceth a beam at the hand of a man that shapeth a ship's timber with skill, and thereby is the man's blow strengthened; even such is thy heart undaunted in thy breast.
Argumentative:Cast not in my teeth the lovely gifts of golden Aphrodite; not to be flung aside are the gods' glorious gifts that of their own good will they give; for by his desire can no man win them.
Argumentative:And whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand, let him take all the wealth aright, and the woman, and bear them home.
Argumentative:And let the rest pledge friendship and sure oaths; so may ye dwell in deep-soiled Troy, and let them depart to Argos pasture-land of horses, and Achaia home of fair women."
Argumentative:But the flowing-haired Achaians kept shooting at him, aiming with arrows and casting stones.
Argumentative:He biddeth the other Trojans and all the Achaians to lay down their goodly armour on the bounteous earth, and himself in the midst and Menelaos dear to Ares to fight alone for Helen and all her wealth.
Argumentative:And whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand, let him take all the wealth aright, and the woman, and bear them home; but let all of us pledge friendship and sure oaths."
Argumentative:And call hither great Priam, that he may pledge the oath himself, seeing he hath sons that are overweening and faithless, lest any by transgression do violence to the oath of Zeus; for young men's hearts are ever lifted up.
Argumentative:But wheresoever an old man entereth in, he looketh both before and after, whereby the best issue shall come for either side."
Argumentative:So spake he, and Achaians and Trojans were glad, deeming that they should have rest from grievous war.
Argumentative:So they refrained their chariots to the ranks, and themselves alighted and doffed their arms.
Argumentative:And Hector sent two heralds to the city will all speed, to bring the lambs, and to call Priam.
Argumentative:Now Iris went with a message to white-armed Helen in the likeness of her husband's sister, the spouse of Antenor's son, even her that lord Helikaon Antenor's son had to wife, Laodike fairest favoured of Priam's daughters.
Argumentative:But Alexandros and Menelaos dear to Ares will fight with their tall spears for thee; and thou wilt be declared the dear wife of him that conquereth."
Argumentative:Forthwith she veiled her face in shining linen, and hastened from her chamber, letting fall a round tear; not unattended, for there followed with her two handmaidens, Aithre daughter of Pittheus and ox-eyed Klymene.
Argumentative:Then came she straightway to the place of the Skaian gates.
Argumentative:And they that were with Priam and Panthoos and Thymoites and Lampos and Klytios and Hiketaon of the stock of Ares, Oukalegon withal and Antenor, twain sages, being elders of the people, sat at the Skaian gates.
Argumentative:These had now ceased from battle for old age, yet were they right good orators, like grasshoppers that in a forest sit upon a tree and utter their lily-like [supposed to mean "delicate" or "tender"] voice; even so sat the elders of the Trojans upon the tower.
Argumentative:I hold thee not to blame; nay, I hold the gods to blame who brought on me the dolorous war of the Achaians - so mayest thou now tell me who is this huge hero, this Achaian warrior so goodly and great.
Argumentative:Of a truth there are others even taller by a head; yet mine eyes never behold a man so beautiful nor so royal; for he is like unto one that is a king."
Argumentative:Yet were not even they so many as are the glancing-eyed Achaians."
Argumentative:His armour lieth upon the bounteous earth, and himself like a bell-wether rangeth the ranks of warriors.
Argumentative:But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like unto the snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus; then marvelled we not thus to behold Odysseus' aspect."
Argumentative:And long-robed Helen, fair among women, answered: "This is huge Aias, bulwark of the Achaians.
Argumentative:And on the other side amid the Cretans standeth Idomeneus like a god, and about him are gathered the captains of the Cretans.
Argumentative:Oft did Menelaos dear to Ares entertain him in our house whene'er he came from Crete.
Argumentative:And now behold I all the other glancing-eyed Achaians, whom well I could discern and tell their names; but two captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of horses and Polydeukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren, whom the same mother bare.
Argumentative:Meanwhile were the heralds bearing through the city the holy oath-offerings, two lambs and strong-hearted wine, the fruit of the earth, in a goat-skin bottle.
Argumentative:But Alexandros and Menelaos dear to Ares will fight with their long spears for the lady's sake; and let lady and treasure go with him that shall conquer.
Argumentative:And may we that are left pledge friendship and trusty oaths and dwell in deep-soiled Troy, and they shall depart to Argos pasture-land of horses and Achaia home of fair women."
Argumentative:So said he, and the old man shuddered and base his companions yoke the horses; and they with speed obeyed.
Argumentative:So the two drave the fleet horses through the Skaian gates to the plain.
Argumentative:And when they had come even to the Trojans and Achaians, they went down from the chariots upon the bounteous earth, and marched into the midst of Trojans and Achaians.
Argumentative:And Atreides put forth his hand and drew his knife that hung ever beside his sword's great sheath, and cut the hair from off the lambs' heads; and then the heralds portioned it among the chief of the Trojans and Achaians.
Argumentative:Then in their midst Atreus' son lifted up his hands and prayed aloud: "Father Zeus, that rulest from Ida, most glorious, most great, and thou Sun that seest all things and hearest all things, and ye Rivers and thou Earth, and ye that in the underworld punish men outworn, whosoever sweareth falsely; be ye witnesses, and watch over the faithful oath.
Argumentative:But if golden-haired Menelaos slay Alexandros, then let the Trojans give back Helen and all her possessions and pay the Argives the recompense that is seemly, such as shall live among men that shall be hereafter.
Argumentative:So said he, and cut the lambs' throats with the pitiless knife.
Argumentative:Them he laid gasping upon the ground, failing of breath, for the knife had taken their strength from them; and next they drew the wine from the bowl into the cups, and poured it forth and prayed to the gods that live for ever.
Argumentative:And thus would say many an one of Achaians and Trojans: "Zeus most glorious, most great, and all ye immortal gods, which folk soe'er be first to sin against the oaths, may their brains be so poured forth upon the earth even as this wine, theirs and their children's; and let their wives be made subject unto strangers."
Argumentative:So spake they, but the son of Kronos vouchsafed not yet fulfilment.
Argumentative:I verily will return back to windy Ilios, seeing that I can in no wise bear to behold with mine eyes my dear son fighting with Menelaos dear to Ares.
Argumentative:Then the people sat them down by ranks where each man's high-stepping horses and inwrought armour lay.
Argumentative:And upon his shoulders goodly Alexandros donned his beauteous armour, even he that was lord to Helen of the lovely hair.
Argumentative:First upon his legs set he his greaves, beautiful, fastened with silver ankle-clasps; next upon his breast he donned the corslet of his brother Lykaon, and fitted it upon himself.
Argumentative:And over his shoulders cast he his silver-studded sword of bronze, and then a shield great and sturdy.
Argumentative:And in like wise warlike Menelaos donned his armour.
Argumentative:So when they had armed themselves on either side in the throng, they strode between Trojans and Achaians, fierce of aspect, and wonder came on them that beheld, both on the Trojans tamers of horses and on the well-greaved Achaians.
Argumentative:Then took they their stand near together in the measured space, brandishing their spears in wrath each against other.
Argumentative:First Alexandros hurled his far shadowing spear, and smote on Atreides' round shield; but the bronze brake not through, for its point was turned in the stout shield.
Argumentative:Next Menelaos son of Atreus lifted up his hand to cast, and made prayer to father Zeus: "King Zeus, grant me revenge on him that was first to do me wrong, even on goodly Alexandros, and subdue thou him at my hands; so that many an one of men that shall be hereafter may shudder to wrong his host that hath shown him kindness."
Argumentative:So said he, and poised his far-shadowing spear, and hurled, and smote on the round shield of the son of Priam.
Argumentative:Through the bright shield went the ponderous spear and through the inwrought breastplate it pressed on; and straight beside his flank the spear rent the tunic, but he swerved and escaped black death.
Argumentative:Now would Menelaos have dragged him away and won glory unspeakable, but that Zeus' daughter Aphrodite was swift to mark, and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered ox's hide; so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand.
Argumentative:Thereat Menelaos cast it with a swing toward the well-greaved Achaians, and his trusty comrades took it up; and himself sprang back again eager to slay him with spear of bronze.
Argumentative:Even in her likeness fair Aphrodite spake: "Come hither; Alexandros summoneth thee to go homeward.
Argumentative:Therefore thou comest hither with guileful intent.
Argumentative:Now when they were come to the beautiful house of Alexandros the handmaidens turned straightway to their tasks, and the fair lady went to the high-roofed chamber; and laughter-loving Aphrodite took for her a chair and brought it, even she the goddess, and set it before the face of Paris.
Argumentative:Verily it was once thy boast that thou wast a better man than Menelaos dear to Ares, in the might of thine arm and thy spear.
Argumentative:But go now, challenge Menelaos, dear to Ares to fight thee again face to face.
Argumentative:For now indeed hath Menelaos vanquished me with Athene's aid, but another day may I do so unto him; for we too have gods with us.
Argumentative:Thus laid they them upon their fretted couch; but Atreides the while strode through the host like to a wild beast, if anywhere he might set eyes on godlike Alexandros.
Argumentative:But none of the Trojans or their famed allies could discover Alexandros to Menelaos dear to Ares.
Argumentative:Yet surely did they in no wise hide him for kindliness, could any have seen him; for he was hated of all even as black death.
Argumentative:So Agamemnon king of men spake among them there: "Hearken to me, Trojans and Dardanians and allies.

Argumentative:For thus will I declare, and even so shall the fulfilment be; I will maim their fleet horses in the chariot, and them will I hurl out from the car, and will break in pieces the chariot; neither within the courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the thunderbolt shall tear; that the bright-eyed one may know the end when she striveth against her father.
Argumentative:Homer - The Iliad - Ancinet-Mythology.com Homer - The Iliad Book VIII How Zeus bethought him of his promise to avenge Achilles' wrong on Agamemnon; and therefore bade the gods refrain from war, and gave victory to the Trojans.
Argumentative:One thing let none essay, be it goddess or be it god, to wit, to thwart my saying; approve ye it all together, that with all speed I may accomplish these things.
Argumentative:Whomsoever I shall perceive minded to go, apart from the gods, to succour Trojans or Danaans, chastened in no seemly wise shall he return to Olympus, or I will take and cast him into misty Tartaros, right far away, where is the deepest gulf beneath the earth; there are the gate of iron and threshold of bronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth: then shall he know how far I am mightiest of all gods.
Argumentative:Thereafter would I bind the rope about a pinnacle of Olympus, and so should all those things be hung in air.
Argumentative:So saying he let harness to his chariot his bronze-shod horses, fleet of foot, with flowing manes of gold; and himself clad him with gold upon his flesh, and grasped the whip of gold, well wrought, and mounted upon his car, and lashed the horses to start them; they nothing loth sped on between earth and starry heaven.
Argumentative:So fared he to many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, even unto Gargaros, where is his demesne and fragrant altar.
Argumentative:Likewise the Trojans on their side armed them throughout the town - a smaller host, yet for all that were they eager to fight in battle, of forceful need, for their children's sake and their wives'.
Argumentative:So when they were met together and come unto one spot, then clashed they targe and spear and fury of bronze-clad warrior; the bossed shields pressed each on each, and mighty din arose.
Argumentative:Then had Idomeneus no heart to stand, neither Agamemnon, neither stood the twain Aiantes, men of Ares' company.
Argumentative:Only Nestor of Gerenia stood his ground, he the Warden of the Achaians; neither he of purpose, but his horse was fordone, which noble Alexandros, beauteous-haired Helen's lord, had smitten with an arrow upon the top of the crest where the foremost hairs of horses grow upon the skull; and there is the most deadly spot.
Argumentative:While the old man leapt forth and with his sword began to hew the traces, came Hector's fleet horses through the tumult, bearing a bold charioteer, even Hecktor.
Argumentative:Beware lest as thou fleest one plant a spear between thy shoulders.
Argumentative:Then the two squires tended Nestor's horses, even Sthenelos the valiant and kindly Eurymedon: and the other twain both mounted upon Diomedes' car.
Argumentative:Then Tydeus' son hurled at him as he charged straight upon them: him missed he, but his squire that drave his chariot, Eniopeus, high-hearted Thebaios' son, even him as he held the reins, he smote upon the breast beside the nipple.
Argumentative:Then sore grief encompassed Hector's soul for sake of his charioteer.
Argumentative:Then had destruction come and deeds beyond remedy been wrought, and so had they been penned in Ilios like lambs, had not the father of gods and men been swift to mark.
Argumentative:And the shining reins dropped from Nestor's hands, and he was afraid at heart and spake to Diomedes: "Come now Tydeides, turn back thy whole-hooved horses to flight: seest thou not that victory from Zeus attendeth not on thee?
Argumentative:Now doth Kronos' son vouchsafe glory to this Hector, for the day; hereafter shall he grant it us likewise, if he will.
Argumentative:A man may not at all ward off the will of Zeus, not though one be very valiant; he verily is mightier far."
Argumentative:And over him shouted loudly great Hector of the glancing helm: "Tydeides, the fleet-horsed Danaans were wont to honour thee with the highest place, and meats, and cups brimful, but now will they disdain thee; thou art after all no better than a woman.
Argumentative:Begone, poor puppet; not for my flinching shalt thou climb on our towers, neither carry our wives away upon thy ships; ere that will I deal thee thy fate."
Argumentative:Thrice doubted he in heart and soul, and thrice from Ida's mountains thundered Zeus the lord of counsel, and gave to the Trojans a sign, the turning of the course of battle.
Argumentative:I perceive that of good will Kronion vouchsafest me victory and great glory, and to the Danaans destruction.
Argumentative:Fools, that devised these walls weak and of none account; they shall not withhold our fury, and lightly shall our steeds overleap the delved foss.
Argumentative:So spake he and shouted to his steeds, and said: "Xanthos, and thou Podargos, and Aithon and goodly Lampos, now pay me back your tending, even the abundance that Andromache, great-hearted Eetion's daughter, set before you of honey-hearted wheat, and mingled wine to drink at the heart's bidding.
Argumentative:Pursue ye now and haste, that we may seize Nestor's shield, the fame whereof now reacheth unto heaven, how that it is of gold throughout, armrods and all; and may seize moreover from horse-taming Diomedes' shoulders his richly dight breastplate that Hephaistos wrought cunningly.
Argumentative:And now had he burned the trim ships with blazing fire, but that queen Hera put it in Agamemnon's heart himself to bestir him and swiftly arouse the Achaians.
Argumentative:So he went his way along the huts and ships of the Achaians, holding a great cloak of purple in his stalwart hand, and stood by Odysseus' black ship of mighty burden, that was in the midst, so that a voice could be heard to either end.
Argumentative:Then shouted he in a piercing voice, and called to the Danaans aloud: "Fie upon you, Argives, ye sorry things of shame, so brave in semblance!
Argumentative:Whither are gone our boastings when we said that we were bravest, the boasts ye uttered vaingloriously when in Lemnos, as ye ate your fill of flesh of tall-horned oxen and drank goblets crowned with wine, and said that every man should stand in war to face fivescore yea tenscore Trojans?
Argumentative:yet now can we not match one, even this Hector that anon will burn our ships with flame of fire.
Argumentative:O Father Zeus, didst ever thou blind with such a blindness any mighty king, and rob him of great glory?
Argumentative:Nay, Zeus, this hope fulfil thou me; suffer that we ourselves at least flee and escape, neither suffer that the Achaians be thus vanquished of the Trojans."
Argumentative:Now could no man of the Danaans, for all they were very many, boast that he before Tydeus' son had guided his fleet horses forth, and driven them across the trench and fought man to man; first by far was Tydeides to slay a warrior of the Trojans in full array, even Agelaos son of Phradmon.
Argumentative:Now he had turned his steeds to flee; but as he wheeled the other plunged the spear into his back between his shoulders, and drave it through his breast.
Argumentative:And after him came Atreus' sons, even Agamemnon and Menelaos, and after them the Aiantes clothed upon with impetuous valour, and after them Idomeneus and Idomeneus' brother in arms Meriones, peer of Enyalios slayer of men, and after them Eurypylos, Euaimon's glorious son.
Argumentative:And so Aias would stealthily withdraw the shield, and Teukros would spy his chance; and when he had shot and smitten one in the throng, then fell such an one and gave up the ghost, and Teukros would return, and as a child beneath his mother, so gat he him to Aias; who hid him with the shining shield.
Argumentative:Verily with such strength as is in me forbear I not, but ever since we drave them towards Ilios I watch with my bow to slay the foemen.
Argumentative:Then sore grief encompassed Hector's soul for his charioteer's sake; yet left he him, though he sorrowed for his comrade, and bade Kebriones his own brother, being hard by, take the chariot reins; and he heard and disregarded not.
Argumentative:Now Teukros had plucked forth from his quiver a keen arrow, and laid it on the string; but even as he drew it back, Hector of the glancing helm smote him with the jagged stone, as he aimed eagerly against him, even beside his shoulder, where the collar-bone fenceth off neck and breast, and where is the most deadly spot; and he brake the bowstring, and his hand from the wrist grew numb, and he stayed fallen upon his knee, and his bow dropped from his hand.
Argumentative:But Aias disregarded not his brother's fall, but ran and strode across him and hid him with his shield.
Argumentative:Then two trusty comrades bent down to him, even Mekisteus son of Echios and goodly Alastor, and bare him, groaning sorely, to the hollow ships.
Argumentative:So they drove the Achaians straight toward the deep foss, and amid the foremost went Hector exulting in his strength.
Argumentative:But Hector wheeled round his beauteous-maned steeds this way and that, and his eyes were as the eyes of Gorgon or Ares bane of mortals.
Argumentative:Now at the sight of them the white-armed goddess Hera had compassion, and anon spake winged words to Athene: "Out on it, thou child of aegis-bearing Zeus, shall not we twain any more take thought for the Danaans that perish, if only for this last time?
Argumentative:Now will they fill up the measure of evil destiny and perish by one man's onslaught; seeing that he is furious now beyond endurance, this Hector son of Priam, and verily hath wrought many a deed of ill."
Argumentative:And the bright-eyed goddess Athene made answer to her, "Yea in good sooth, may this fellow yield up strength and life, and perish at the Argives' hands in his native land; only mine own sire is furious, with no good intent, headstrong, ever sinful, the foiler of my purposes.
Argumentative:Surely shall many a Trojan likewise glut dogs and birds with fat and flesh, fallen dead at the ships of the Achaians."
Argumentative:For him also the noble Shaker of Earth unyoked the steeds, and set the car upon the stand, and spread a cloth thereover; and far-seeing Zeus himself sate upon his golden throne, and beneath his feet great Olympus quaked.
Argumentative:Surely ye are not wearied of making havoc in glorious battle of the Trojans, for whom ye cherish bitter hate!
Argumentative:Howsoever, seeing that my might is so great and my hands invincible, all the gods that are in Olympus could not turn me: and for you twain, trembling erst gat hold upon your bright limbs ere that ye beheld war and war's fell deeds.
Argumentative:Well know we, even we, that thy might is no wise puny; yet still have we pity for the Danaan spearmen, that now shall perish and fill up the measure of grievous fate."
Argumentative:And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered and said: "At morn shalt thou behold most mighty Kronion, if thou wilt have it so, O Hera, ox-eyed queen, making yet more havoc of the vast army of Argive spearmen; for headlong Hector shall not refrain from battle till that Peleus' son fleet of foot have arisen beside the ships, that day when these shall fight amid the sterns in most grievous stress, around Patroklos fallen.
Argumentative:And the sun's bright light dropped into Ocean, drawing black night across Earth the grain-giver.
Argumentative:So let us now yield to black night, and make our supper ready; unyoke ye from the chariots your fair-maned horses, and set fodder beside them.
Argumentative:And let the heralds dear to Zeus proclaim throughout the city that young maidens and old men of hoary heads camp round the city on the battlements builded of the gods; and let the women folk burn a great fire each in her hall; and let there be a sure watch set, lest an ambush enter the city when the host is absent.
Argumentative:Howbeit for the night will we guard our own selves, and at morn by daybreak, arrayed in our armour, let us awake keen battle at the hollow ships.
Argumentative:I will know whether Tydeus' son stalwart Diomedes shall thrust me from the ships back to the wall, or I shall lay him low with my spear and bear away his gory spoils.
Argumentative:To-morrow shall he prove his valour, whether he can abide the onslaught of my spear.
Argumentative:And they loosed their sweating steeds from the yoke, and tethered them with thongs, each man beside his chariot; and from the city they brought kine and goodly sheep with speed, and provided them with honey-hearted wine and corn from their houses, and gathered much wood withal.
Argumentative:But these with high hopes sate them all night along the highways of the battle, and their watchfires burned in multitude.
Argumentative:Even as when in heaven the stars about the bright moon shine clear to see, when the air is windless, and all the peaks appear and the tall headlands and glades, and from heaven breaketh open the infinite air, and all stars are seen, and the shepherd's heart is glad; even in like multitude between the ships and the streams of Xanthos appeared the watchfires that the Trojans kindled in front of Ilios.
Argumentative:A thousand fires burned in the plain and by the side of each sate fifty in the gleam of blazing fire.
Argumentative:And the horses champed white barley and spelt, and standing by their chariots waited for the throned Dawn.

Argumentative:The Odyssey: Book IV - Ancinet-Mythology.com The Odyssey Book IV And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides 'midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen's power, To bless his son's and daughter's nuptial hour.
Argumentative:That day, to great Achilles son resign'd, Hermione, the fairest of her kind, Was sent to crown the long-protracted joy, Espoused before the final doom of Troy; With steeds and gilded cars, a gorgeous train Attend the nymphs to Phthia's distant reign.
Argumentative:Meanwhile at home, to Megapentha's bed The virgin choir Alector's daughter led.
Argumentative:Brave Megapenthas From a stolen amour To great Atrides' age his handmaid bore; To Helen's bed the gods alone assign Hermione, to extend the regal line; On whom a radiant pomp oh Graces wait, Resembling Venus in attractive state.
Argumentative:While this gay friendly troop the king surround, With festival and mirth the roofs resound; A bard amid the joyous circle sings High airs attemper'd to the vocal strings; Whilst warbling to the varied strain, advance Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance, 'Twas then, that issuing through the palace gate, The splendid car roll'd slow in regal state: On the bright eminence young Nestor shone, And fast beside him great Ulysses' son; Grave Eteoneous saw the pomp appear, And speeding, thus address'd the royal ear; "Two youths approach, whose semblant features prove Their blood devolving from the source of Jove Is due reception deign'd, or must they bend Their doubtful course to seek a distant friend?"
Argumentative:(with a sigh the king replies,) Too long, misjudging, have I thought thee wise But sure relentless folly steals thy breast, Obdurate to reject the stranger-guest; To those dear hospitable rites a foe, Which in my wanderings oft relieved my woe; Fed by the bounty of another's board, Till pitying Jove my native realm restored-- Straight be the coursers from the car released, Conduct the youths to grace the genial feast."
Argumentative:From room to room their eager view they bend Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend; Where a bright damsel train attends the guests With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests.
Argumentative:When thus the king, with hospitable port; "Accept this welcome to the Spartan court: The waste of nature let the feast repair, Then your high lineage and your names declare; Say from what sceptred ancestry ye claim, Recorded eminent in deathless fame, For vulgar parents cannot stamp their race With signatures of such majestic grace."
Argumentative:Ceasing, benevolent he straight assigns The royal portion of the choicest chines To each accepted friend; with grateful haste They share the honours of the rich repast.
Argumentative:Sufficed, soft whispering thus to Nestor's son, His head reclined, young Ithacus begun: "View'st thou unmoved, O ever-honour'd most!
Argumentative:These prodigies of art, and wondrous cost!
Argumentative:Above, beneath, around the palace shines The sunless treasure of exhausted mines; The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay, And studded amber darts the golden ray; Such, and not nobler, in the realms above My wonder dictates is the dome of Jove."
Argumentative:The monarch took the word, and grave replied: "Presumptuous are the vaunts, and vain the pride Of man, who dares in pomp with Jove contest, Unchanged, immortal, and supremely blest!
Argumentative:With all my affluence, when my woes are weigh'd, Envy will own the purchase dearly paid.
Argumentative:Next Aethiopia's utmost bound explore, And the parch'd borders of the Arabian shore; Then warp my voyage on the southern gales, O'er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails; That happy clime, where each revolving year The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear; And two fair crescents of translucent horn The brows of all their young increase adorn: The shepherd swains, with sure abundance blest, On the fat flock and rural dainties feast; Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail, But every season fills the foaming pail.
Argumentative:had the gods so large a boon denied And life, the just equivalent supplied To those brave warriors, who, with glory fired Far from their country, in my cause expired!
Argumentative:Still in short intervals of pleasing woe.
Argumentative:Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear.
Argumentative:Ulysses--deeper than the rest That sad idea wounds my anxious breast!
Argumentative:My heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain; The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain; Nor sleep's soft power can close my streaming eyes, When imaged to my soul his sorrows rise.
Argumentative:No peril in my cause he ceased to prove, His labours equall'd only by my love: And both alike to bitter fortune born, For him to suffer, and for me to mourn!
Argumentative:While thus pathetic to the prince he spoke, From the brave youth the streaming passion broke; Studious to veil the grief, in vain repress'd, His face he shrouded with his purple vest.
Argumentative:The conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise, And view'd his filial love with vast surprise: Dubious to press the tender theme, or wait To hear the youth inquire his father's fate.
Argumentative:In this suspense bright Helen graced the room; Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume.
Argumentative:Alcandra, consort of his high command, A golden distaff gave to Helen's hand; And that rich vase, with living sculpture wrought, Which heap'd with wool the beauteous Phylo brought The silken fleece, impurpled for the loom, Rivall'd the hyacinth in vernal bloom.
Argumentative:The sovereign seat then Jove born Helen press'd, And pleasing thus her sceptred lord address'd: "Who grace our palace now, that friendly pair, Speak they their lineage, or their names declare?
Argumentative:the lovely boy, Who bless'd Ulysses with a father's joy, What time the Greeks combined their social arms, To avenge the stain of my ill-fated charms!"
Argumentative:"Just is thy thought, (the king assenting cries,) Methinks Ulysses strikes my wondering eyes; Full shines the father in the filial frame, His port, his features, and his shape the same; Such quick regards his sparkling eyes bestow; Such wavy ringlets o'er his shoulders flow And when he heard the long disastrous store Of cares, which in my cause Ulysses bore; Dismay'd, heart-wounded with paternal woes, Above restraint the tide of sorrow rose; Cautious to let the gushing grief appear, His purple garment veil'd the falling tear."
Argumentative:Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung, But modest awe hath chain'd his timorous tongue.
Argumentative:with pleased attention heard, Is like the dictates of a god revered.
Argumentative:With him, at Nestor's high command, I came, Whose age I honour with a parent's name.
Argumentative:By adverse destiny constrained to sue For counsel and redress, he sues to you Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears, Bereaved of parents in his infant years, Still must the wrong'd Telemachus sustain, If, hopeful of your aid, he hopes in vain; Affianced in your friendly power alone, The youth would vindicate the vacant throne."
Argumentative:"Is Sparta blest, and these desiring eyes View my friend's son?
Argumentative:I, to confirm the mutual joys we shared, For his abode a capital prepared; Argos, the seat of sovereign rule, I chose; Fair in the plan the future palace rose, Where my Ulysses and his race might reign, And portion to his tribes the wide domain, To them my vassals had resign'd a soil, With teeming plenty to reward their toil.
Argumentative:There with commutual zeal we both had strove In acts of dear benevolence and love: Brothers in peace, not rivals in command, And death alone dissolved the friendly band!
Argumentative:Some envious power the blissful scene destroys; Vanish'd are all the visionary joys; The soul of friendship to my hope is lost, Fated to wander from his natal coast!"
Argumentative:the living can bestow; O'er the congenial dust enjoin'd to shear The graceful curl, and drop the tender tear.
Argumentative:Then, mingling in the mournful pomp with you, I'll pay my brother's ghost a warrior's due, And mourn the brave Antilochus, a name Not unrecorded in the rolls of fame; With strength and speed superior form'd, in fight To face the foe, or intercept his flight; Too early snatch'd by fate ere known to me!
Argumentative:Whene'er his influence Jove vouchsafes to shower, To bless the natal and the nuptial hour; From the great sire transmissive to the race, The boon devolving gives distinguish'd grace.
Argumentative:Such, happy Nestor!
Argumentative:To move thy suit, Telemachus, delay, Till heaven's revolving lamp restores the day."
Argumentative:He said, Asphalion swift the laver brings; Alternate, all partake the grateful springs; Then from the rites of purity repair, And with keen gust the savoury viands share.
Argumentative:Meantime, with genial joy to warm the soul, Bright Helen mix'd a mirth inspiring bowl; Temper'd with drugs of sovereign use, to assuage The boiling bosom of tumultuous rage; To clear the cloudy front of wrinkled Care, And dry the tearful sluices of Despair; Charm'd with that virtuous draught, the exalted mind All sense of woe delivers to the wind.
Argumentative:Or a loved brother groan'd his life away.
Argumentative:Or darling son, oppress'd by ruffian force, Fell breathless at his feet, a mangled corse; From morn to eve, impassive and serene, The man entranced would view the dreadful scene These drugs, so friendly to the joys of life.
Argumentative:Bright Helen learn'd from Thone's imperial wife; Who sway'd the sceptre, where prolific Nile With various simples clothes the fatten'd soil.
Argumentative:With wholesome herbage mix'd, the direful bane Of vegetable venom taints the plain; From Paeon sprung, their patron-god imparts To all the Pharian race his healing arts.
Argumentative:The beverage now prepared to inspire the feast, The circle thus the beauteous queen addressed: "Throned in omnipotence, supremest Jove Tempers the fates of human race above; By the firm sanction of his sovereign will, Alternate are decreed our good and ill.
Argumentative:"Seam'd o'er with wounds, which his own sabre gave, In the vile habit of a village slave, The foe deceived, he pass'd the tented plain, In Troy to mingle with the hostile train.
Argumentative:Exploring then the secrets of the state, He learn'd what best might urge the Dardan fate; And, safe returning to the Grecian host, Sent many a shade to Pluto's dreary coast.
Argumentative:Loud grief resounded through the towers of Troy, But my pleased bosom glow'd with secret joy: For then, with dire remorse and conscious shame I view'd the effects of that disastrous flame.
Argumentative:Some demon, anxious for the Trojan doom, Urged you with great Deiphobus to come, To explore the fraud; with guile opposed to guile.
Argumentative:Slow-pacing thrice around the insidious pile, Each noted leader's name you thrice invoke, Your accent varying as their spouses spoke!
Argumentative:The pleasing sounds each latent warrior warm'd, But most Tydides' and coy heart alarm'd: To quit the steed we both impatient press Threatening to answer from the dark recess.
Argumentative:But now let sleep the painful waste repair Of sad reflection and corroding care."
Argumentative:He ceased; the menial fair that round her wait, At Helen's beck prepare the room of state; Beneath an ample portico they spread The downy fleece to form the slumberous bed; And o'er soft palls of purple grain unfold Rich tapestry, stiff with interwoven gold: Then, through the illumined dome, to balmy rest The obsequious herald guides each princely guest; While to his regal bower the king ascends, And beauteous Helen on her lord attends.
Argumentative:Soon as the morn, in orient purple dress'd, Unbarr'd the portal of the roseate east, The monarch rose; magnificent to view, The imperial mantle o'er his vest he threw; The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast, A starry falchion low-depending graced; Clasp'd on his feet the embroidered sandals shine; And forth he moves, majestic and divine, Instant to young Telemachus he press'd; And thus benevolent his speech addressed: "Say, royal youth, sincere of soul report Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court?
Argumentative:relate The mournful series of my father's fate: Each known disaster of the man disclose, Born by his mother to a world of woes!
Argumentative:Recite them; nor in erring pity fear To wound with storied grief the filial ear.
Argumentative:If e'er Ulysses, to reclaim your right, Avow'd his zeal in council or in fight, If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest, To the sire's merit give the son's request."
Argumentative:would a soft, inglorious, dastard train An absent hero's nuptial joys profane!
Argumentative:So with her young, amid the woodland shades, A timorous hind the lion's court invades, Leaves in the fatal lair the tender fawns, Climbs the green cliff, or feeds the flowery lawns: Meantime return'd, with dire remorseless sway, The monarch-savage rends the trembling prey.
Argumentative:With equal fury, and with equal fame, Ulysses soon shall reassert his claim.
Argumentative:O Jove supreme, whom gods and men revere!
Argumentative:to whom 'tis given to gild the sphere!
Argumentative:With power congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid!
Argumentative:Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when contending on the Lesbian shore His prowess Philomelidies confess'd, And loud-acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd; Then soon the invaders of his bed and throne Their love presumptous shail with life atone.
Argumentative:For this the gods each favouring gale restrain Jealous, to see their high behests obey'd; Severe, if men the eternal rights evade.
Argumentative:There, anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lie, Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply.
Argumentative:' "Struck with the loud reproach, I straight reply: 'Whate'er thy title in thy native sky, A goddess sure!
Argumentative:Watch with insidious care his known abode; There fast in chains constrain the various god; Who bound, obedient to superior force, Unerring will prescribe your destined course.
Argumentative:If, studious on your realms, you then demand Their state, since last you left your natal land, Instant the god obsequious will disclose Bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes.
Argumentative:Emerging from the wave, The Phocas swift surround his rocky cave, Frequent and full; the consecrated train Of her, whose azure trident awes the main; There wallowing warm, the enormous herd exhales An oily steam, and taints the noontide gales.
Argumentative:To that recess, commodious for surprise, When purple light shall next suffuse the skies, With me repair; and from thy warrior-band Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul commamd; Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil; For strong the god, and perfected in guile.
Argumentative:Strech'd on the shelly shore, he first surveys The flouncing herd ascending from the seas; Their numher summ'd, reposed in sleep profound The scaly charge their guardian god surround; So with his battening flocks the careful swain Abides pavilion'd on the grassy plain.
Argumentative:With powers united, obstinately bold, Invade him, couch'd amid the scaly fold; Instant he wears, elusive of the rape, The mimic force of every savage shape; Or glides with liquid lapse a murmuring stream, Or, wrapp'd in flame, he glows at every limb.
Argumentative:Yet, still retentive, with redoubled might, Through each vain passive form constrain his flight But when, his native shape renamed, he stands Patient of conquest, and your cause demands; The cause that urged the bold attempt declare, And soothe the vanquish'd with a victor's prayer.
Argumentative:The bands releas'd, implore the seer to say What godhead interdicts the watery way.
Argumentative:Who, straight propitious, in prophetic strain Will teach you to repass the unmeasured main.
Argumentative:Fast by the deep, Along the tented shore, in balmy sleep, Our cares were lost.
Argumentative:the prophet's piercing eye to shun; New from the corse, the scaly frands diffuse Unsavoury stench of oil, and brackish ooze; But the bright sea-maid's gentle power implored, With nectar'd drops the sickening sense restored.
Argumentative:At last, sublime, his stately growth he rears A tree, and well-dissembled foliage wears.
Argumentative:' I thus: 'O thou, whose certain eye foresees The fix'd event of fate's remote decrees; After long woes, and various toil endured, Still on this desert isle my fleet is moor'd, Unfriended of the gales.
Argumentative:All-knowing, say, What godhead interdicts the watery way?
Argumentative:What vows repentant will the power appease, To speed a prosperous voyage o'er the seas.
Argumentative:Once more the Nile, who from the secret source Of Jove's high seat descends with sweepy force, Must view his billows white beneath thy oar, And altars blaze along his sanguine shore.
Argumentative:Then will the gods with holy pomp adored, To thy long vows a safe return accord.
Argumentative:Must I the warriors weep, Whelm'd in the bottom of the monstrous deep?
Argumentative:"'Press not too far,' replied the god: 'but cease To know what, known, will violate thy peace; Too curious of their doom!
Argumentative:with friendly woe Thy breast will heave, and tears eternal flow.
Argumentative:the rest, a lamentable train!
Argumentative:Range the dark bounds of Pluto's dreary reign.
Argumentative:Two, foremost in the roll of Mars renown'd, Whose arms with conquest in thy cause were crown'd, Fell by disastrous fate: by tempests toss'd, A third lives wretched on a distant coast.
Argumentative:"By Neptune rescued from Minerva's hate, On Gyrae, safe Oilean Ajax sate, His ship o'erwhelm'd; but, frowning on the floods, Impious he roar'd defiance to the gods; To his own prowess all the glory gave: The power defrauding who vouchsafed to save.
Argumentative:"By Juno's guardian aid, the watery vast, Secure of storms, your royal brother pass'd, Till, coasting nigh the cape where Malen shrouds Her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds, A whirling gust tumultuous from the shore Across the deep his labouring vessel bore.
Argumentative:In an ill-fated hour the coast he gain'd, Where late in regal pomp Thyestes reigned; But, when his hoary honours bow'd to fate, Aegysthus govern'd in paternal state, The surges now subside, the tempest ends; From his tall ship the king of men descends; There fondly thinks the gods conclude his toil: Far from his own domain salutes the soil; With rapture oft the urge of Greece reviews, And the dear turf with tears of joy bedews.
Argumentative:Him, thus exulting on the distant stand, A spy distinguish'd from his airy stand; To bribe whose vigilance, Aegysthus told A mighty sum of ill-persuading gold: There watch'd this guardian of his guilty fear, Till the twelfth moon had wheel'd her pale career; And now, admonish'd by his eye, to court With terror wing'd conveys the dread report.
Argumentative:Of deathful arts expert, his lord employs The ministers of blood in dark surprise; And twenty youths, in radiant mail incased, Close amhush'd nigh the spacious hall he placed.
Argumentative:Then bids prepare the hospitable treat: Vain shows of love to veil his felon hate!
Argumentative:To grace the victor's welcome from the wars, A train of coursers and triumphal cars Magnificent he leads: the royal guest, Thoughtless of ill, accepts the fraudful feast.
Argumentative:So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall, The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall, The partners of his fame and toils at Troy, Around their lord, a mighty ruin, lie: Mix'd with the brave, the base invaders bleed; Aegysthus sole survives to boast the deed."
Argumentative:But when, superior to the rage of woe, I stood restored and tears had ceased to flow, Lenient of grief the pitying god began: 'Forget the brother, and resume the man.
Argumentative:To Fate's supreme dispose the dead resign, That care be Fate's, a speedy passage thine Still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplored, But lives a victim for thy vengeful sword; Unless with filial rage Orestes glow, And swift prevent the meditated blow: You timely will return a welcome guest, With him to share the sad funereal feast."
Argumentative:view'd, When streaming grief his faded cheek bedow'd.
Argumentative:But vain his prayer, his arts are vain, to move The enamour'd goddess, or elude her love: His vessel sunk, and dear companions lost, He lives reluctant on a foreign coast.
Argumentative:This grace peculiar will the gods afford To thee, the son of Jove, and beauteous Helen's lord.
Argumentative:' "He ceased, and plugning in the vast profound, Beneath the god and whirling billows bound.
Argumentative:Soon as the morn reveals the roseate east, With sails we wing the masts, our anchors weigh, Unmoor the fleet, and rush into the sea.
Argumentative:Ranged on the banks, beneath our equal oars White curl the waves, and the vex'd ocean roars Then, steering backward from the Pharian isle, We gain the stream of Jove-descended Nile; There quit the ships, and on the destined shore With ritual hecatombs the gods adore; Their wrath atoned, to Agamemnon's name A cenotaph I raise of deathless fame.
Argumentative:These rites to piety and grief discharged, The friendly gods a springing gale enlarged; The fleet swift tilting o'er the surges flew, Till Grecian cliffs appear'd a blissful view!
Argumentative:His hand the king with tender passion press'd, And, smiling, thus the royal youth address'd: "O early worth!
Argumentative:a soul so wise, and young, Proclaims you from the sage Ulysses sprung.
Argumentative:Selected from my stores, of matchless price, An urn shall recompense your prudent choice; By Vulcan's art, the verge with gold enchased.
Argumentative:Thus they alternate; while, with artful care, The menial train the regal feast prepare.
Argumentative:The firstlings of the flock are doom'd to die: Rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply; A female band the gift of Ceres bring; And the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring.
Argumentative:Unknowing of the course to Pyle design'd, A sudden horror seized on either mind; The prince in rural bower they fondly thought, Numbering his flocks and herds, not far remote.
Argumentative:With him, the peerage next in power to you; And Mentor, captain of the lordly crew, Or some celestial in his reverend form, Safe from the secret rock and adverse storm, Pilot's the course; for when the glimmerering ray Of yester dawn disclosed the tender day, Mentor himself I saw, and much admired," Then ceased the youth, and from the court retired.
Argumentative:Rage sparkling in his eyes, and burning in his breast "O shame to manhood!
Argumentative:shall one daring boy The scheme of all our happiness destroy?
Argumentative:Fly unperceived, seducing half the flower Of nobles, and invite a foreign power?
Argumentative:The ponderous engine raised to crush us all, Recoiling, on his head is sure to fall.
Argumentative:Instant prepare me, on the neighbouring strand, With twenty chosen mates a vessel mann'd; For ambush'd close beneath the Samian shore His ship returning shall my spies explore; He soon his rashness shall with life atone, Seek for his father's fate, but find his own."
Argumentative:With vast applause the sentence all approve; Then rise, and to the feastful hall remove; Swift to the queen the herald Medon ran, Who heard the consult of the dire divan: Before her dome the royal matron stands, And thus the message of his haste demands; "What will the suitors?

Argumentative:The Odyssey: Book VI - Ancinet-Mythology.com The Odyssey Book VI While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest, And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast, The martial maid from heavens aerial height Swift to Phaeacia wing'd her rapid flight, In elder times the soft Phaeacian train In ease possess'd the wide Hyperian plain; Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose A lawless nation of gigantic foes; Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far, Through seas retreating from the sounds of war, The recreant nation to fair Scheria led, Where never science rear'd her laurell'd head; There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised; To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed; Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds, And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.

Argumentative:A just applause the cares of dress impart, And give soft transport to a parent's heart.
Argumentative:Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way, When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray; Haste to the stream!
Argumentative:companion of thy care, Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share.
Argumentative:the marriage hour is nigh, See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh!
Argumentative:Then to the palaces of heaven she sails, Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales; The seat of gods; the regions mild of peace, Full joy, and calm eternity of ease.
Argumentative:There no rude winds presume to shake the skies, No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise; But on immortal thrones the blest repose; The firmament with living splendours glows.
Argumentative:Up rose the virgin with the morning light, Obedient to the vision of the night.
Argumentative:Meanwhile Phaeacia's peers in council sate; From his high dome the king descends in state; Then with a filial awe the royal maid Approach'd him passing, and submissive said: "Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign, And may his child the royal car obtain?
Argumentative:A dignity of dress adorns the great, And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.
Argumentative:And spotless robes become the young and gay; So when with praise amid the dance they shine, By these my cares adorn'd that praise is mine."
Argumentative:Swift at the royal nod the attending train The car prepare, the mules incessant rein, The blooming virgin with despatchful cares Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears.
Argumentative:The queen, assiduous to her train assigns The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines.
Argumentative:whose soft refreshing streams Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs.
Argumentative:They seek the cisterns where Phaeacian dames Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams; Where, gathering into depth from falling rills, The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.
Argumentative:Along the skies, Toss'd and retoss'd, the ball incessant flies.
Argumentative:They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice, And, warbling sweet, makes earth and heaven rejoice.
Argumentative:As when o'er Erymanth Diana roves, Or wide Tuygetus' resounding groves ; A sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds, Her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds: Fierce in the sport, along the mountain's brow They bay the boar, or chase the bounding roe; High o'er the lawn, with more majestic pace, Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace; Distinguish'd excellence the goddess proves; Exults Latona as the virgin moves.
Argumentative:With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain, And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train.
Argumentative:but Pallas now address'd To break the bands of all-composing rest.
Argumentative:Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends, With forceful strength a branch the hero rends; Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads A wreathy foliage and concealing shades.
Argumentative:If in that bright disguise Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies, Hail, Dian, hail!
Argumentative:the huntress of the groves So shines majestic, and so stately moves, So breathes an air divine!
Argumentative:Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide, To such a miracle of charms allied: Joyful they see applauding princes gaze, When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze.
Argumentative:But blest o'er all, the youth with heavenly charms, Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms!
Argumentative:Thus seems the palm with stately honours crown'd By Phoebus' altars; thus o'erlooks the ground; The pride of Delos.
Argumentative:for earth ne'er knew to bear A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair.
Argumentative:Inured to cares, to death in all its forms; Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms.
Argumentative:Propitious to my wants a vest supply To guard the wretched from the inclement sky: So may the gods, who heaven and earth control, Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul, On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed; Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed; Blest be thy husband with a blooming race, And lasting union crown your blissful days. The gods, when they supremely bless, bestow Firm union on their favourites below; Then envy grieves, with inly-pining hate; The good exult, and heaven is in our state."
Argumentative:Bear, with a soul resign'd, the will of Jove; Who breathes, must mourn: thy woes are from above.
Argumentative:But since thou tread'st our hospitable shore, 'Tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more, To clothe the naked, and thy way to guide.
Argumentative:Then to her maids: "Why, why, ye coward train, These fears, this flight?
Argumentative:dismiss that idle dread, 'Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread; Safe in the love of heaven, an ocean flows Around our realm, a barrier from the foes; 'Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve, Cheer the sad heart, nor let affliction grieve.
Argumentative:By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent; And what to those we give to Jove is lent.
Argumentative:To them the king: "No longer I detain Your friendly care: retire, ye virgin train!
Argumentative:since this worn frame refection know, What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view!
Argumentative:But, nymphs, recede!
Argumentative:The nymphs withdrawn, at once into the tide Active he bounds; the flashing waves divide O'er all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse, And from his locks compress the weedy ooze; The balmy oil, a fragrant shower, be sheds; Then, dressed, in pomp magnificently treads.
Argumentative:The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine With majesty enlarged, and air divine: Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls, His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls.
Argumentative:Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas, Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze.
Argumentative:The maids the viands and the bowl supplied: Eager he fed, for keen his hunger raged, And with the generous vintage thirst assuaged.
Argumentative:Close to the bay great Neptune's fane adjoins; And near, a forum flank'd with marble shines, Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store, Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar: For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill; But the tall mast above the vessel rear, Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air.
Argumentative:They rush into the deep with eager joy, Climb the steep surge, and through the tempest fly; A proud, unpolish'd race--To me belongs The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues; Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame, Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name: 'What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads!
Argumentative:All, all the godlike worthies that adorn This realm, she flies: Phaeacia is her scorn.
Argumentative:Hence lies the town, as far as to the ear Floats a strong shout along the waves of air.
Argumentative:Arrived, advance, impatient of delay, And to the lofty palace bend thy way: The lofty palace overlooks the town, From every dome by pomp superior known; A child may point the way.
Argumentative:Till great Ulysses hail'd his native land.

Argumentative:The prince, obedient to the sage command, To Euryclea thus: "The female band In their apartments keep; secure the doors; These swarthy arms among the covert stores Are seemlier hid; my thoughtless youth they blame, Imbrown'd with vapour of the smouldering flame."
Argumentative:He said: from female ken she straight secures The purposed deed, and guards the bolted doors: Auxiliar to his son, Ulysses bears The plumy-crested helms and pointed spears, With shields indented deep in glorious wars.
Argumentative:Not such the sickly beams, which unsincere Gild the gross vapour of this nether sphere!
Argumentative:A present deity the prince confess'd, And wrapp'd with ecstasy the sire address'd: "What miracle thus dazzles with surprise!
Argumentative:Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise; The walls, where'er my wondering sight I turn, And roofs, amidst a blaze of glory burn!
Argumentative:With tapers flaming day his train attends, His bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends: Soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close, Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows.
Argumentative:Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air.
Argumentative:An ivory seat with silver ringlets graced, By famed Icmalius wrought, the menials placed: With ivory silver'd thick the footstool shone, O'er which the panther's various hide was thrown.
Argumentative:Vagrant, begone!
Argumentative:before this blazing brand Shall urge"--and waved it hissing in her hand.
Argumentative:The insulted hero rolls his wrathful eyes And "Why so turbulent of soul?
Argumentative:Constrain'd a rent-charge on the rich I live; Reduced to crave the good I once could give: A palace, wealth, and slaves, I late possess'd, And all that makes the great be call'd the bless'd: My gate, an emblem of my open soul, Embraced the poor, and dealt a bounteous dole.
Argumentative:Scorn not the sad reverse, injurious maid!
Argumentative:'Tis Jove's high will, and be his will obey'd!
Argumentative:Nor think thyself exempt: that rosy prime Must share the general doom of withering time: To some new channel soon the changeful tide Of royal grace the offended queen may guide; And her loved lord unplume thy towering pride.
Argumentative:Or, were he dead, 'tis wisdom to beware: Sweet blooms the prince beneath Apollo's care; Your deeds with quick impartial eye surveys, Potent to punish what he cannot praise."
Argumentative:Her keen reproach had reach'd the sovereign's ear: "Loquacious insolent!
Argumentative:But thou on whom my palace cares depend, Eurynome, regard the stranger-friend: A seat, soft spread with furry spoils, prepare; Due-distant for us both to speak, and hear."
Argumentative:whose far-resounding fame Is bounded only by the starry frame, Consummate pattern of imperial sway, Whose pious rule a warlike race obey!
Argumentative:In wavy gold thy summer vales are dress'd; Thy autumns bind with copious fruit oppress'd: With flocks and herds each grassy plain is stored; And fish of every fin thy seas afford: Their affluent joys the grateful realms confess; And bless the power that still delights to bless, Gracious permit this prayer, imperial dame!
Argumentative:Forbear to know my lineage, or my name: Urge not this breast to heave, these eyes to weep; In sweet oblivion let my sorrows sleep!
Argumentative:My woes awaked, will violate your ear, And to this gay censorious train appear A whiny vapour melting in a tear."
Argumentative:My lord's protecting hand alone would raise My drooping verdure, and extend my praise!
Argumentative:Peers from the distant Samian shore resort: Here with Dulichians join'd, besiege the court: Zacynthus, green with ever-shady groves, And Ithaca, presumptuous, boast their loves: Obtruding on my choice a second lord, They press the Hymenaean rite abhorr'd.
Argumentative:Misrule thus mingling with domestic cares, I live regardless of my state affairs; Receive no stranger-guest, no poor relieve; But ever for my lord in secret grieve!
Argumentative:For when to fate he bows, each Grecian dame With just reproach were licensed to defame, Should he, long honour'd in supreme command, Want the last duties of a daughter's hand.
Argumentative:' The fiction pleased; their loves I long elude; The night still ravell'd what the day renew'd: Three years successful in my heart conceal'd, My ineffectual fraud the fourth reveal'd: Befriended by my own domestic spies, The woof unwrought the suitor-train surprise.
Argumentative:From nuptial rites they now no more recede, And fear forbids to falsify the brede.
Argumentative:My anxious parents urge a speedy choice, And to their suffrage gain the filial voice.
Argumentative:For rule mature, Telemachus deplores His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores-- But, stranger!
Argumentative:as thy days seem full of fate, Divide discourse, in turn thy birth relate: Thy port asserts thee of distinguish'd race; No poor unfather'd product of disgrace."
Argumentative:So pays the wretch whom fate constrains to roam, The dues of nature to his natal home!
Argumentative:-- But inward on my soul let sorrow prey, Your sovereign will my duty bids obey.
Argumentative:"Crete awes the circling waves, a fruitful soil!
Argumentative:'Twas then to Crete the great Ulysses came.
Argumentative:For elemental war, and wintry Jove, From Malea's gusty cape his navy drove To bright Lucina's fane; the shelfy coast Where loud Amnisus in the deep is lost.
Argumentative:Twelve days while Boreas vex'd the aerial space, My hospitable dome he deign'd to grace: And when the north had ceased the stormy roar, He wing'd his voyage to the Phrygian shore."
Argumentative:A speechless interval of grief ensues, Till thus the queen the tender theme renews.
Argumentative:that e'er thy hospitable roof Ulysses graced, confirm by faithful proof; Delineate to my view my warlike lord, His form, his habit, and his train record."
Argumentative:--In ample mode, A robe of military purple flow'd O'er all his frame: illustrious on his breast, The double-clasping gold the king confess'd.
Argumentative:In the rich woof a hound, mosaic drawn, Bore on full stretch, and seized a dappled fawn; Deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold; They pant and struggle in the moving gold.
Argumentative:Fine as a filmy web beneath it shone A vest, that dazzled like a cloudless sun: The female train who round him throng'd to gaze, In silent wonder sigh'd unwilling praise.
Argumentative:A sabre, when the warrior press'd to part, I gave, enamell'd with Vulcanian art: A mantle purple-tinged, and radiant vest, Dimension'd equal to his size, express'd Affection grateful to my honour'd guest.
Argumentative:A favourite herald in his train I knew, His visage solemn, sad of sable hue: Short woolly curls o'erfleeced his bending head, O'er which a promontory shoulder spread; Eurybates; in whose large soul alone Ulysses view'd an image of his own."
Argumentative:The vest much envied on your native coast, And regal robe with figured gold emboss'd, In happier hours my artful hand employ'd, When my loved lord this blissful bower enjoy'd: The fall of Troy erroneous and forlorn Doom'd to survive, and never to return!"
Argumentative:Your ever-anxious mind, and beauteous frame, From the devouring rage of grief reclaim.
Argumentative:I not the fondness of your soul reprove For such a lord!
Argumentative:Suggest, that Jove the peaceful thought inspired, Lest they, by sight of swords to fury fired, Dishonest wounds, or violence of soul, Defame the bridal feast and friendly bowl."
Argumentative:who crown'd your virgin love With the dear blessing of a fair increase; Himself adorn'd with more than mortal grace: Yet while I speak the mighty woe suspend; Truth forms my tale; to pleasing truth attend.
Argumentative:That race who emulate the life of gods, Receive him joyous to their bless'd abodes; Large gifts confer, a ready sail command, To speed his voyage to the Grecian strand.
Argumentative:Thus lives your lord; nor longer doom'd to roam; Soon will he grace this dear paternal dome.
Argumentative:By Jove, the source of good, supreme in power!
Argumentative:By the bless'd genius of this friendly bower!
Argumentative:I ratify my speech, before the sun His annual longitude of heaven shall run; When the pale empress of yon starry train In the next month renews her faded wane, Ulysses will assert his rightful reign."
Argumentative:My lord's return should fate no more retard, Envy shall sicken at thy vast reward.
Argumentative:But my prophetic fears, alas!
Argumentative:presage The wounds of Destiny's relentless rage.
Argumentative:I long must weep, nor will Ulysses come, With royal gifts to send you honour'd home!
Argumentative:-- Your other task, ye menial train forbear: Now wash the stranger, and the bed prepare: With splendid palls the downy fleece adorn: Uprising early with the purple morn.
Argumentative:His sinews, shrunk with age, and stiff with toil, In the warm bath foment with fragrant oil.
Argumentative:Then with Telemachus the social feast Partaking free, my soul invited guest; Whoe'er neglects to pay distinction due, The breach of hospitable right may rue.
Argumentative:A narrow space Confines the circle of our destin'd race; 'Tis ours with good the scanty round to grace.
Argumentative:Those who to cruel wrong their state abuse, Dreaded in life the mutter'd curse pursues; By death disrobed of all their savage powers, Then, licensed rage her hateful prey devours.
Argumentative:But he whose inborn worth his acts commend, Of gentle soul, to human race a friend; The wretched he relieves diffuse his fame, And distant tongues extol the patron-name."
Argumentative:Nor will my heart-corroding care abate With splendid palls, and canopies of state: Low-couch'd on earth, the gift of sleep I scorn, And catch the glances of the waking morn.
Argumentative:Such servant as your humble choice requires, To light received the lord of my desires, New from the birth; and with a mother's hand His tender bloom to manly growth sustain'd: Of matchless prudence, and a duteous mind; Though now to life's extremest verge declined, Of strength superior to the toil design'd- Rise, Euryclea!
Argumentative:with officious care For the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare: This debt his correspondent fortunes claim, Too like Ulysses, and perhaps the same!
Argumentative:Thus old with woes my fancy paints him now!
Argumentative:Instant, obsequious to the mild command, Sad Euryclea rose: with trembling hand She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes; And thus impasaion'd to herself replies: "Son of my love, and monarch of my cares, What pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears!
Argumentative:Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid With pious deed, and pure devotion, paid?
Argumentative:The pious vows are lost; His God forgets him on a foreign coast!
Argumentative:-- Perhaps, like thee, poor guest!
Argumentative:Conscious of worth reviled, thy generous mind The friendly rite of purity declined; My will concurring with my queen's command, Accept the bath from this obsequious hand.
Argumentative:A strong emotion shakes my anguish'd breast: In thy whole form Ulysses seems express'd; Of all the wretched harboured on our coast, None imaged e'er like thee my master lost."
Argumentative:Thus half-discover'd through the dark disguise, With cool composure feign'd, the chief replies: "You join your suffrage to the public vote; The same you think have all beholders thought."
Argumentative:He said: replenish'd from the purest springs, The laver straight with busy care she brings: In the deep vase, that shone like burnish'd gold, The boiling fluid temperates the cold.
Argumentative:Meantime revolving in his thoughtful mind The scar, with which his manly knee was sign'd; His face averting from the crackling blaze, His shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays: Thus cautious in the obscure he hoped to fly The curious search of Euryclea's eye.
Argumentative:Cautious in vain!
Argumentative:Then thus the hoary chief: "My victor arms Have awed the realms around with dire alarms: A sure memorial of my dreaded fame The boy shall bear; Ulysses be his name!
Argumentative:And when with filial love the youth shall come To view his mother's soil, my Delphic dome With gifts of price shall send him joyous home."
Argumentative:Lured with the promised boon, when youthful prime Ended in man, his mother's natal clime Ulysses sought; with fond affection dear Amphitea's arms received the royal heir: Her ancient lord an equal joy possess'd; Instant he bade prepare the genial feast: A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled, Whose stately growth five flowery summers fed: His sons divide, and roast with artful care The limbs; then all the tasteful viands share.
Argumentative:Their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppress'd, Sated they rose, and all retired to rest.
Argumentative:Parnassus, thick perplex'd with horrid shades, With deep-mouth'd hounds the hunter-troop invades; What time the sun, from ocean's peaceful stream, Darts o'er the lawn his horizontal beam.
Argumentative:Deep in the rough recesses of the wood, A lofty copse, the growth of ages, stood; Nor winter's boreal blast, nor thunderous shower, Nor solar ray, could pierce the shady bower.
Argumentative:The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar.
Argumentative:Roused by the hounds' and hunters' mingling cries, The savage from his leafy shelter flies; With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine, And bristles high impale his horrid chine.
Argumentative:Young lthacus advanced, defies the foe, Poising his lifted lance in act to throw; The savage renders vain the wound decreed, And springs impetuous with opponent speed!
Argumentative:With bandage firm Ulysses' knee they bound; Then, chanting mystic lays, the closing wound Of sacred melody confess'd the force; The tides of life regain'd their azure course.
Argumentative:He safe at Ithaca with joy received, Relates the chase, and early praise achieved.
Argumentative:Smiles dew'd with tears the pleasing strife express'd Of grief and joy, alternate in her breast.
Argumentative:Her fluttering words in melting murmurs died; At length abrupt--"My son!
Argumentative:His neck with fond embrace infolding fast, Full on the queen her raptured eye she cast Ardent to speak the monarch safe restored: But, studious to conceal her royal lord, Minerva fix'd her mind on views remote, And from the present bliss abstracts her thought.
Argumentative:His hand to Euryclea's mouth applied, "Art thou foredoom'd my pest?
Argumentative:An exile have I told, with weeping eyes, Full twenty annual suns in distant skies; At length return'd, some god inspires thy breast To know thy king, and here I stand confess'd.
Argumentative:This heaven-discover'd truth to thee consign'd, Reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind: Else, if the gods my vengeful arm sustain, And prostrate to my sword the suitor-train; With their lewd mates, thy undistinguish'd age Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage."
Argumentative:Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured; With ribs of steel, and marble heart, immured.
Argumentative:When Heaven, auspicious to thy right avow'd, Shall prostrate to thy sword the suitor-crowd, The deeds I'll blazon of the menial fair; The lewd to death devote, the virtuous spare."
Argumentative:Adjusting to his limbs the tatter'd vest, His former seat received the stranger guest; Whom thus with pensive air the queen addressed: "Though night, dissolving grief in grateful ease, Your drooping eyes with soft impression seize; Awhile, reluctant to her pleasing force, Suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse.
Argumentative:As when the months are clad in flowery green, Sad Philomel, in bowery shades unseen, To vernal airs attunes her varied strains; And Itylus sounds warbling o'er the plains; Young Itylus, his parents' darling joy!
Argumentative:So in nocturnal solitude forlorn, A sad variety of woes I mourn!
Argumentative:My mind, reflective, in a thorny maze Devious from care to care incessant strays.
Argumentative:Now, wavering doubt succeeds to long despair; Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere; And, joining to my son's my menial train, Partake his counsels, and assist his reign?
Argumentative:to his will accord; And from the peers select the noblest lord; So by my choice avow'd, at length decide These wasteful love-debates, a mourning bride!
Argumentative:The bird of Jove Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove; Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway, And back triumphant wing'd his airy way.
Argumentative:My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream, To view their death thus imaged in a dream; With tender sympathy to soothe my soul, A troop of matrons, fancy-form'd, condole.
Argumentative:When from the downy bands of sleep released, Fsat by the limpid lake my swan-like train I found, insatiate of the golden grain."
Argumentative:So, when the sun restores the purple day, Their strength and skill the suitors shall assay; To him the spousal honour is decreed, Who through the rings directs the feather'd reed.
Argumentative:yet me withdrawn, Wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn Establish'd use enjoins; to rest and joy Estranged, since dear Ulysses sail'd to Troy!
Argumentative:Meantime instructed is the menial tribe Your couch to fashion as yourself prescribe."

Argumentative:To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread, Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed.
Argumentative:To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes, My will may covet, but my power denies.
Argumentative:If this raise anger in the stranger's thought, The pain of anger punishes the fault: The very truth I undisguised declare; For what so easy as to be sincere?"
Argumentative:To want like mine the peopled town can yield More hopes of comfort than the lonely field: Nor fits my age to till the labour'd lands, Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands.
Argumentative:but since this ragged garb can bear So ill the inclemencies of morning air, A few hours' space permit me here to stay: My steps Eumaeus shall to town convey, With riper beams when Phoebus warms the day."
Argumentative:Thus he: nor aught Telemachus replied, But left the mansion with a lofty stride: Schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate, Revolving deep the suitors' sudden fate, Arriving now before the imperial hall, He props his spear against the pillar'd wall; Then like a lion o'er the threshold bounds; The marble pavement with his steps resounds: His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds: She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace, And reach'd her master with a long embrace.
Argumentative:So snatch'd from all our cares!
Argumentative:--Tell, hast thou known Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own."
Argumentative:most revered of womankind!
Argumentative:Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers; With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers; To every god vow hecatombs to bleed.
Argumentative:And call Jove's vengeance on their guilty deed.
Argumentative:She bathed; and, robed in white, with all her train, To every god vow'd hecatombs to bleed, And call'd Jove's vengeance on the guilty deed, Arm'd with his lance, the prince then pass'd the gate, Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await; Pallas his form with grace divine improves: The gazing crowd admires him as he moves.
Argumentative:Him, gathering round, the haughty suitors greet With semblance fair, but inward deep deceit, Their false addresses, generous, he denied.
Argumentative:Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses' fame, Much ask'd the seniors; till Peiraeus came.
Argumentative:The stranger-guest pursued him close behind; Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join'd.
Argumentative:He (when Peiraeus ask'd for slaves to bring The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king) Thus thoughtful answer'd: "Those we shall not move, Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove; We know not yet the full event of all: Stabb'd in his palace if your prince must fall, Us, and our house, if treason must o'erthrow, Better a friend possess them than a foe; If death to these, and vengeance Heaven decree, Riches are welcome then, not else, to me.
Argumentative:Till then retain the gifts."
Argumentative:--The hero said, And in his hand the willing stranger led.
Argumentative:The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings, Replenish'd from the pure translucent springs; With copious streams that golden ewer supplies A silver layer of capacious size.
Argumentative:They wash: the table, in fair order spread, Is piled with viands and the strength of bread.
Argumentative:Full opposite, before the folding gate, The pensive mother sits in humble state; Lowly she sate, and with dejected view The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew.
Argumentative:The prince and stranger shared the genial feast, Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased.
Argumentative:The least glad tidings of my absent lord?"
Argumentative:"We reach'd the Pylian plains, Where Nestor, shepherd of his people, reigns.
Argumentative:All arts of tenderness to him are known, Kind to Ulysses' race as to his own; No father with a fonder grasp of joy Strains to his bosom his long-absent boy.
Argumentative:But all unknown, if yet Ulysses breathe, Or glide a spectre in the realms beneath; For farther search, his rapid steeds transport My lengthen'd journey to the Spartan court.
Argumentative:My cause of coming told, he thus rejoin'd; And still his words live perfect in my mind: "'Heavens!
Argumentative:would a soft, inglorious, dastard train An absent hero's nuptial joys profane So with her young, amid the woodland shades, A timorous hind the lion's court invades, Leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns, And climbs the cliffs, or feeds along the lawns; Meantime returning, with remorseless sway The monarch savage rends the panting prey: With equal fury, and with equal fame, Shall great Ulysses reassert his claim.
Argumentative:whom men and gods revere; And thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere!
Argumentative:With power congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid!
Argumentative:Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when, contending on the Lesbian shore, His prowess Philomelides confess'd, And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd: Then soon the invaders of his bed, and throne, Their love presumptuous shall by death atone.
Argumentative:No sailors there, no vessels to convey, No oars to cut the immeasurable way.
Argumentative:Before the first of gods be this declared, Before the board whose blessings we have shared; Witness the genial rites, and witness all This house holds sacred in her ample wall!
Argumentative:E'en now, this instant, great Ulysses, laid At rest, or wandering in his country's shade, Their guilty deeds, in hearing, and in view, Secret revolves; and plans the vengeance due.
Argumentative:Of this sure auguries the gods bestow'd, When first our vessel anchor'd in your road."
Argumentative:"Succeed those omens, Heaven!
Argumentative:Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled, And the proud steer was o'er the marble spread.
Argumentative:While thus the copious banquet they provide, Along the road, conversing side by side, Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain; When thus Eumaeus, generous and humane: "To town, observant of our lord's behest, Now let us speed; my friend no more my guest!
Argumentative:Yet like myself I wish thee here preferr'd, Guard of the flock, or keeper of the herd, But much to raise my master's wrath I fear; The wrath of princes ever is severe.
Argumentative:Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung, Wide-patch'd, and fasten'd by a twisted thong.
Argumentative:And now his city strikes the monarch's eyes, Alas!
Argumentative:With an envious look He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke: "The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!
Argumentative:Heaven with a secret principle endued Mankind, to seek their own similitude.
Argumentative:Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look'd guest?
Argumentative:That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast!
Argumentative:Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn, From every great man's gate repulsed with scorn: To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain, 'Twas but for scraps he ask'd, and ask'd in vain.
Argumentative:To beg, than work, he better understands, Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.
Argumentative:For any office could the slave be good, To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food.
Argumentative:He thus: nor insolent of word alone, Spurn'd with his rustic heel his king unknown; Spurn'd, but not moved: he like a pillar stood, Nor stirr'd an inch, contemptuous, from the road: Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead, Or greet the pavement with his worthless head.
Argumentative:who from the ethereal bowers Descend to swell the springs, and feed the flowers!
Argumentative:to whose sacred names Our rural victims mount in blazing flames!
Argumentative:To whom Ulysses' piety preferr'd The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd; Succeed my wish, your votary restore: Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore!
Argumentative:Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence, And humble all his airs of insolence, Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large, Commences courtier, and neglects his charge."
Argumentative:The day shall come--nay, 'tis already near-- When, slave!
Argumentative:to sell thee at a price too dear Must be my care; and hence transport thee o'er, A load and scandal to this happy shore.
Argumentative:that as surely great Apollo's dart, Or some brave suitor's sword, might pierce the heart Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour In lasting safety from the father's power!"
Argumentative:So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray, Turn'd his proud step, and left them on their way.
Argumentative:Straight to the feastful palace he repair'd, Familiar enter'd, and the banquet shared; Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord, He took his place, and plenty heap'd the board.
Argumentative:Stage above stage the imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours, and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes.
Argumentative:Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear; For like their lawless lords the servants are."
Argumentative:not fated long to please his lord; To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain; The voice of glory call'd him o'er the main.
Argumentative:Now left to man's ingratitude he lay, Unhoused, neglected in the public way; And where on heaps the rich manure was spread, Obscene with reptiles, took his sordid bed.
Argumentative:Soft pity touch'd the mighty master's soul; Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole, Stole unperceived: he turn'd his head and dried The drop humane: then thus impassion'd cried: "What noble beast in this abandon'd state Lies here all helpless at Ulysses' gate?
Argumentative:His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise: If, as he seems, he was in better days, Some care his age deserves; or was he prized For worthless beauty?
Argumentative:therefore now despised; Such dogs and men there are, mere things of state; And always cherish'd by their friends, the great."
Argumentative:Long, long since perish'd on a distant shore!
Argumentative:The women keep the generous creature bare, A sleek and idle race is all their care: The master gone, the servants what restrains?
Argumentative:Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away."
Argumentative:This said, the honest herdsman strode before; The musing monarch pauses at the door: The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll'd, Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies; So closed for ever faithful Argus' eyes!
Argumentative:Before him instant was the banquet spread, And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.
Argumentative:In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent, Propp'd or a staff, and trembling as he went.
Argumentative:bear, And let yon mendicant our plenty share: And let him circle round the suitors' board, And try the bounty of each gracious lord.
Argumentative:Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me: How ill, alas!
Argumentative:His lord's command the faithful servant bears: The seeming beggar answers with his prayers: "Bless'd be Telemachus!
Argumentative:Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose, Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes To tempt their bounties with a suppliant's art, And learn the generous from the ignoble heart (Not but his soul, resentful as humane, Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train); With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound, Humble he moves, imploring all around.
Argumentative:The proud feel pity, and relief bestow, With such an image touch'd of human woe; Inquiring all, their wonder they confess, And eye the man, majestic in distress.
Argumentative:While thus they gaze and question with their eyes, The bold Melanthius to their thought replies: "My lords!
Argumentative:this stranger of gigantic port The good Eumaeus usher'd to your court.
Argumentative:"And is this present, swineherd!
Argumentative:Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings, To share our feast, and lead the life of kings."
Argumentative:To whom the hospitable swain rejoins: "Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind.
Argumentative:Who calls, from distant nations to his own, The poor, distinguish'd by their wants alone?
Argumentative:Round the wide world are sought those men divine Who public structures raise, or who design; Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal, Or bless with salutary arts to heal; But chief to poets such respect belongs, By rival nations courted for their songs; These states invite, and mighty kings admire, Wide as the sun displays his vital fire.
Argumentative:It is not so with want!
Argumentative:Unjust to me, and all that serve the state, To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate.
Argumentative:To him Telemachus: "No more incense The man by nature prone to insolence: Injurious minds just answers but provoke"-- Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke: "Thanks to thy care!
Argumentative:whose absolute command Thus drives the stranger from our court and land.
Argumentative:Heaven bless its owner with a better mind!
Argumentative:From envy free, to charity inclined.
Argumentative:This both Penelope and I afford: Then, prince!
Argumentative:be bounteous of Ulysses' board.
Argumentative:To give another's is thy hand so slow?
Argumentative:So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?"
Argumentative:"Whence, great Telemachus!
Argumentative:this lofty strain?
Argumentative:(Antinous cries with insolent disdain): Portions like mine if every suitor gave, Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave."
Argumentative:He spoke, and lifting high above the board His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord.
Argumentative:thou dost not seem the worst Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first; Then, as in dignity, be first in worth, And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth.
Argumentative:The spreading clamour to their city flies, And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise: The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields, Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields: Jove thunder'd on their side: our guilty head We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead.
Argumentative:Some few the foe in servitude detain; Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain!
Argumentative:To whom Antinous thus his rage express'd: "What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest?
Argumentative:Unless at distance, wretch!
Argumentative:thou keep behind, Another isle, than Cyprus more unkind, Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find.
Argumentative:From all thou begg'st, a bold audacious slave; Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave.
Argumentative:Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown; Shameless they give, who give what's not their own."
Argumentative:The chief, retiring: "Souls, like that in thee, Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity.
Argumentative:Nor will that hand to utmost need afford The smallest portion of a wasteful board, Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps, Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps."
Argumentative:His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock; He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock; But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain'd, Sedate of soul, his character sustain'd, And inly form'd revenge; then back withdrew: Before his feet the well fill'd scrip he threw, And thus with semblance mild address'd the crew: "May what I speak your princely minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in this noble love!
Argumentative:If, when the sword our country's quarrel draws, Or if, defending what is justly dear, From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear, The generous motive dignifies the scar.
Argumentative:But for mere want, how hard to suffer wrong!
Argumentative:Want brings enough of other ills along!
Argumentative:Yet, if injustice never be secure, If fiends revenge, and gods assert the poor, Death shall lay low the proud aggressor's head, And make the dust Antinous' bridal bed."
Argumentative:"Peace, wretch!
Argumentative:His furious deed the general anger moved, All, even the worst, condemn'd; and some reproved.
Argumentative:Ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound.
Argumentative:The nurse replies: "If Jove receives my prayer, Not one survives to breathe to-morrow's air."
Argumentative:Amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent queen, Then bade Eumaeus call the pilgrim in.
Argumentative:Thus she, and good Eumaeus took the word: "A private audience if thy grace impart, The stranger's words may ease the royal heart.
Argumentative:His sacred eloquence in balm distils, And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills.
Argumentative:Three days have spent their beams, three nights have run Their silent journey, since his tale begun, Unfinish'd yet; and yet I thirst to hear!
Argumentative:He now but waits the wind to waft him o'er, With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia's shore."
Argumentative:For where's an arm, like thine, Ulysses!
Argumentative:Telemachus then sneezed aloud; Constrain'd, his nostril echoed through the crowd.
Argumentative:Then to Eumaeus: "Bring the stranger, fly!
Argumentative:Thus spoke Penelope.
Argumentative:Eumaeus flies In duteous haste, and to Ulysses cries: "The queen invites thee, venerable guest!
Argumentative:If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind Of decent robes a present has design'd: So finding favour in the royal eye, Thy other wants her subjects shall supply."
Argumentative:Let for a space the pensive queen attend, Nor claim my story till the sun descend; Then in such robes as suppliants may require, Composed and cheerful by the genial fire, When loud uproar and lawless riot cease, Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace."
Argumentative:With the begging kind Shame suits but ill."
Argumentative:These sons of murder thirst thy life to take; O guard it, guard it, for thy servant's sake!"
Argumentative:Our life to Heaven's immortal powers we trust, Safe in their care, for Heaven protects the just."
Argumentative:Then instant rose, and as he moved along, 'Twas riot all amid the suitor throng, They feast, they dance, and raise the mirthful song Till now, declining towards the close of day, The sun obliquely shot his dewy ray.

Argumentative:At length appears the long-expected hour!
Argumentative:Ulysses comes!
Argumentative:the suitors are no more!
Argumentative:No more they view the golden light of day!
Argumentative:whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?
Argumentative:The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies, The weak enlighten, and confound the wise, And human thought, with unresisted sway, Depress or raise, enlarge or take away: Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes, And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks.
Argumentative:Unkind, the fond illusion to impose!
Argumentative:Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore, O Troy?
Argumentative:--may never tongue pronounce thee more!
Argumentative:To whom with warmth: "My soul a lie disdains; Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns: That stranger, patient of the suitors' wrongs, And the rude license of ungovern'd tongues!
Argumentative:How could that numerous and outrageous band By one be slain, though by a hero's hand?"
Argumentative:Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow; Enjoy the present good, and former woe.
Argumentative:Ulysses lives, his vanquish'd foes to see; He lives to thy Telemachus and thee!"
Argumentative:to contemn the stranger's righteous cause, And violate all hospitable laws!
Argumentative:For never must Ulysses view this shore; Never!
Argumentative:the loved Ulysses is no more!"
Argumentative:Then, daughter, haste away!
Argumentative:Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way?
Argumentative:Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends, But with alternate joy and fear descends; At every step debates her lord to prove; Or, rushing to his arms, confess her love!
Argumentative:Then gliding through the marble valves, in state Opposed, before the shining sire she sate.
Argumentative:At length Telemachus: "Oh, who can find A woman like Penelope unkind?
Argumentative:Why thus in silence?
Argumentative:why with winning charms Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?
Argumentative:Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows, When twice ten years are pass'd of mighty woes; To softness lost, to spousal love unknown, The gods have formed that rigid heart of stone!"
Argumentative:(the queen rejoin'd,) Distracting fears confound my labouring mind; Powerless to speak.
Argumentative:This day our deepest care requires, Cautious to act what thought mature inspires.
Argumentative:If one man's blood, though mean, distain our hands, The homicide retreats to foreign lands; By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls, The important deed our whole attention calls."
Argumentative:the queen weds!
Argumentative:' The suitor's death, unknown, till we remove Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove."
Argumentative:Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey, At once they bathe, and dress in proud array: The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance, And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.
Argumentative:Thus they--but nobly chaste she weds no more.
Argumentative:Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends; With faithful cares Eurynome attends, O'er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds; Then, dress'd in pomp, magnificent he treads.
Argumentative:The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine With majesty enlarged, and grace divine.
Argumentative:Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly His thick large locks of hyacinthino dye.
Argumentative:As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives His heavenly skill, a breathing image lives; By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould, And the pale silver glows with fusile gold: So Pallas his heroic form improves With bloom divine, and like a god he moves!
Argumentative:More high he treads, and issuing forth in state, Radiant before his gazing consort sate.
Argumentative:Canst thou, Penelope, when heaven restores Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores, Canst thou, O cruel!
Argumentative:Fix'd in my soul, as when he sailed to Troy, His image dwells: then haste the bed of joy, Haste, from the bridal bower the bed translate, Fram'd by his hand, and be it dress'd in state!"
Argumentative:Thus speaks the queen, still dubious, with disguise Touch'd at her words, the king with warmth replies "Alas for this!
Argumentative:what mortal strength can move The enormous burden, who but Heaven above?
Argumentative:It mocks the weak attempts of human hands!
Argumentative:But the whole earth must move if Heaven commands Then hear sure evidence, while we display Words seal'd with sacred truth and truth obey: This hand the wonder framed; an olive spread Full in the court its ever verdant head.
Argumentative:While yet he speaks, her powers of life decay; She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away.
Argumentative:O versed in every, turn of human art, Forgive the weakness of a woman's heart!
Argumentative:The righteous powers, that mortal lot dispose, Decree us to sustain a length of woes.
Argumentative:And from the flower of life the bliss deny To bloom together, fade away, and die.
Argumentative:Men, faithless men, betray Our easy faith, and make our sex their prey: Against the fondness of my heart I strove: 'Twas caution, O my lord!
Argumentative:not want of love.
Argumentative:Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms; Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day; Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray.
Argumentative:But why these sorrows when my lord arrives?
Argumentative:my own Ulysses lives!
Argumentative:As to the shipwreck'd mariner, the shores Delightful rise, when angry Neptune roars: Then, when the surge in thunder mounts the sky, And gulf'd in crowds at once the sailors die; If one, more happy, while the tempest raves, Outlives the tumult of conflicting waves, All pale, with ooze deform'd, he views the strand, And plunging forth with transport grasps the land: The ravish'd queen with equal rapture glows, Clasps her loved lord, and to his bosom grows.
Argumentative:Beam o'er the eastern hills with streaming light.
Argumentative:But end we here--the night demands repose, Be deck'd the couch!
Argumentative:and peace awhile, my woes!"
Argumentative:To whom the queen: "Thy word we shall obey, And deck the couch; far hence be woes away: Since the just gods, who tread the starry plains, Restore thee safe, since my Ulysses reigns.
Argumentative:But what those perils heaven decrees, impart; Knowledge may grieve, but fear distracts the heart."
Argumentative:To this the king: "Ah, why must I disclose A dreadful story of approaching woes?
Argumentative:Why in this hour of transport wound thy ears, When thou must learn what I must speak with tears?
Argumentative:Unknown to pain, in age resign my breath, When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death; To the dark grave retiring as to rest; My people blessing, by my people bless'd.
Argumentative:Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display By their dread seer, and such my future day."
Argumentative:To whom thus firm of soul: "If ripe for death, And full of days, thou gently yield thy breath; While Heaven a kind release from ills foreshows, Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes?"
Argumentative:Then how, unharm'd, he pass'd the Syren-coasts, The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves, And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves, The cave of death!
Argumentative:But now I haste to bless Laertes' eyes With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies; The good old man, to wasting woes a prey, Weeps a sad life in solitude away.

Argumentative:Thus jovial they; but nought the prince replies; Full on his sire he roll'd his ardent eyes: Impatient straight to flesh his virgin-sword; From the wise chief he waits the deathful word.
Argumentative:That others feeds on planetary schemes, And pays his host with hideous noon-day dreams.
Argumentative:O'er the protracted feast the suitors sit, And aim to wound the prince with pointless wit: Cries one, with scornful leer and mimic voice, "Thy charity we praise, but not thy choice; Why such profusion of indulgence shown To this poor, timorous, toil-detesting drone?
Argumentative:Unguided hence my trembling steps I bend, Far hence, before yon hovering deaths descend; Lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun, I share the doom ye suitors cannot shun."
Argumentative:Yet warn'd in vain, with laughter loud elate The peers reproach the sure divine of Fate; And thus Eurymachus: "The dotard's mind To every sense is lost, to reason blind; Swift from the dome conduct the slave away; Let him in open air behold the day."
Argumentative:Nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll, But universal night usurps the pole!"
Argumentative:with Stygian shade Each destin'd peer impending fates invade; With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drown'd; With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round: Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts, To people Orcus, and the burning coasts!
Argumentative:In vision wrapp'd, the Hyperesian seer Uprose, and thus divined the vengeance near: "O race to death devote!
Argumentative:A mirthful frenzy seized the fated crowd; The roofs resound with causeless laughter loud; Floating in gore, portentous to survey!
Argumentative:But Pallas clouds with intellectual gloom The suitors' souls, insensate of their doom!
Argumentative:Sage and serene Telemachus replies: " By him at whose behest the thunder flies, And by the name on earth I most revere, By great Ulysses and his woes I swear!
Argumentative:Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire: The lord selected to the nuptial joys Far hence will lead the long-contested prize: Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless'd, You reign, of this imperial dome possess'd."
Argumentative:Whilst hope prevail'd to see your sire restored, Of right the queen refused a second lord: But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate, To think he still survives to claim the state?
Argumentative:to stop the source of future ill, Assent yourself, and gain the royal will.
Argumentative:your rage restrain From the protected guest, and menial train: And, prince!
Argumentative:A long cessation of discourse ensued, By gentler Agelaus thus renew'd: "A just reproof, ye peers!
Argumentative:The chief indignant grins a ghastly smile; Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil: When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed: "Had not the inglorious wound thy malice aim'd Fall'n guiltless of the mark, my certain spear Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear: Nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast; The suitor, now, had vanish'd in a ghost: No more, ye lewd compeers, with lawless power Invade my dome, my herds and flocks devour: For genuine worth, of age mature to know, My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow Or, if each other's wrongs ye still support, With rapes and riot to profane my court; What single arm with numbers can contend?
Argumentative:He said: and of the steer before him placed, That sinewy fragment at Ulysses cast, Where to the pastern-bone, by nerves combined, The well-horn'd foot indissolubly join'd; Which whizzing high, the wall unseemly sign'd.
Argumentative:Observant of the prince's high behest, His menial train attend the stranger-guest; Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired, By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired.
Argumentative:Without reply vouchsafed, Antinous ceased: Meanwhile the pomp of festival increased: By heralds rank'd; in marshall'd order move The city tribes, to pleased Apollo's grove: Beneath the verdure of which awful shade, The lunar hecatomb they grateful laid; Partook the sacred feast, and ritual honours paid.
Argumentative:"Be patient, peers!
Argumentative:Awed by the prince, so haughty, brave, and young, Rage gnaw'd the lip, amazement chain'd the tongue.
Argumentative:Your violence and scorn, ye suitors, cease, Lest arms avenge the violated peace."
Argumentative:"Partake, my guest (he cried), without control The social feast, and drain the cheering bowl: Dread not the railer's laugh, nor ruffian's rage; No vulgar roof protects thy honour'd age; This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be, From my great sire too soon devolved to me!
Argumentative:Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat; A trivet table, and ignobler seat, The prince appoints; but to his sire assigns The tasteful inwards, and nectareous wines.
Argumentative:With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round, Wine, rosy-bright, the brimming goblets crown'd, By sage Eumaeus borne; the purple tide Melanthius from an ample jar supplied: High canisters of bread Philaetius placed; And eager all devour the rich repast.
Argumentative:the sanguinary scheme suspend: Your future thought let sable fate employ; And give the present hour to genial joy."
Argumentative:This omen eyed Amphinomus, who thus presaging cried: "The gods from force and fraud the prince defend; O peers!
Argumentative:Assents Eumaeus to the prayer address'd; And equal ardours fire his loyal breast.
Argumentative:This sacred truth attest, each genial power, Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bower!
Argumentative:His kind protecting hand my youth preferr'd, The regent of his Cephalenian herd; With vast increase beneath my care it spreads: A stately breed!
Argumentative:Oh, grateful for the good his bounty gave, I'll grieve, till sorrow sink me to the grave!
Argumentative:Like thee, poor stranger guest, denied his home, Like thee: in rags obscene decreed to roam!
Argumentative:Ulysses from his state a wanderer still, Upbraids thy power, thy wisdom, or thy will!
Argumentative:The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man, With penury, contempt, repulse, and care, The galling load of life is doom'd to bear.
Argumentative:for ever death to human cries; The tyrant, not the father of the skies!
Argumentative:Then affable he thus the chief address'd, Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he press'd: "Stranger, may fate a milder aspect show, And spin thy future with a whiter clue!
Argumentative:His lineage and paternal clime declare: Dim through the eclipse of fate, the rays divine Of sovereign state with faded splendour shine.
Argumentative:And goats he brought, the pride of all their race; Imported in a shallop not his own; The dome re-echoed to the mingl'd moan.
Argumentative:A steer ungrateful to the bull's embrace.
Argumentative:Rejoinder to the churl the king disdain'd, But shook his head, and rising wrath restrain'd.
Argumentative:On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast A plenteous board!
Argumentative:Blows have more energy than airy words; These arguments I'll use: nor conscious shame, Nor threats, thy bold intrusion will reclaim.
Argumentative:While thus the chief his woes indignant told, Melanthius, master of the bearded fold, The goodliest goats of all the royal herd Spontaneous to the suitors' feast preferr'd; Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound; With quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound; And to the chief austere aloud began The wretch unfriendly to the race of man: "Here vagrant, still?
Argumentative:No conscious blush, no sense of right, restrains The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins; From vice to vice their appetites are toss'd, All cheaply sated at another's cost!"
Argumentative:the suitor-train Still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain; Or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane?"
Argumentative:Magnificent, and blithe, the suitors come.
Argumentative:His cornel javelin poised with regal port, To the sage Greeks convened in Themis' court, Forth-issuing from the dome the prince repair'd; Two dogs of chase, a lion-hearted guard, Behind him sourly stalked.
Argumentative:The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires, And modest worth with noble scorn retires."
Argumentative:Or waits he grieved, His age not honour'd, nor his wants relieved?
Argumentative:His steps impetuous to the portal press'd; And Euryclea thus he there address'd: "Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes, Was care for due refection and repose Bestow'd the stranger-guest?
Argumentative:Big with their doom denounced in earth and sky, Ulysses' heart dilates with secret joy.
Argumentative:Soon, with consummate joy to crown his prayer, An omen'd voice invades his ravish'd ear.
Argumentative:Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds; With springing hope the hero's heart rebounds.
Argumentative:Whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows, The pitying god his guardian aid avows.
Argumentative:Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above."
Argumentative:with heaven to friend, If the long series of my woes shall end; Of human race now rising from repose, Let one a blissful omen here disclose; And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove!
Argumentative:Thus, whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne, In audible laments she breathes her moan; The sounds assault Ulysses' wakeful ear; Misjudging of the cause, a sudden fear Of his arrival known, the chief alarms; He thinks the queen is rushing to his arms.
Argumentative:When woes the waking sense alone assail, Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil, Of other wretches' care the torture ends; No truce the warfare of my heart suspends!
Argumentative:Or thou, Diana, speed Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead; To seek my lord among the warrior train, Ere second vows my bridal faith profane.
Argumentative:So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphan fair; Were doom'd to wander through the devious air; Thyself untimely, and thy consort died, But four celestials both your cares supplied.
Argumentative:far from human race, Toss'd through the void illimitable space Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud, Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud!
Argumentative:speed thy deathful ebon dart, And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart.
Argumentative:Not so the queen; the downy bands of sleep By grief relax'd she waked again to weep: A gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair; Then thus her fate invoked, with fervent prayer "Diana!
Argumentative:In me affianced, fortify thy breast, Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest My sure divinity shall bear the shield, And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.
Argumentative:Lo, Pallas' self descends, Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends.
Argumentative:Or if, by Jove's and thy auxiliar aid, They're doom'd to bleed; O say, celestial maid!
Argumentative:Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow They name the standard of their dearest vow."
Argumentative:Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast, Tempests of wrath his soul no longer toss'd; Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd As one who long with pale-eyed famine pined, The savoury cates on glowing embers cast Incessant turns, impatient for repast Ulysses so, from side to side-devolved, In self-debate the suitor's doom resolved When in the form of mortal nymph array'd, From heaven descends the Jove-born martial maid; And'hovering o'er his head in view confess'd, The goddess thus her favourite care address'd: "O thou, of mortals most inured to woes!
Argumentative:Not fiercer woes thy fortitude could foil, When the brave partners of thy ten years' toil Dire Polypheme devour'd; I then was freed By patient prudence from the death decreed."
Argumentative:"Poor suffering heart!
Argumentative:His heart with rage this new dishonour stung, Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung: Or instant should he quench the guilty flame With their own blood, and intercept the shame: Or to their lust indulge a last embrace, And let the peers consummate the disgrace Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls, As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls, And bays the stranger groom: so wrath compress'd, Recoiling, mutter'd thunder in his breast.
Argumentative:As thus pavilion'd in the porch he lay, Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey, Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair, With wanton glee, the prostituted fair.
Argumentative:Then o'er the chief, Eurynome the chaste With duteous care a downy carpet cast: With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows, And, ruminating wrath, he scorns repose.

Argumentative:6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
Argumentative:7 They are terrible and dreadful; their law and their majesty proceed from themselves.
Argumentative:8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the wolves of the desert; and their horsemen spread themselves; yea, their horsemen come from far, they fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour.
Argumentative:9 They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as the sand.
Argumentative:10 And they scoff at kings, and princes are a derision unto them; they deride every stronghold, for they heap up earth, and take it.
Argumentative:11 Then their spirit doth pass over and transgress, and they become guilty: even they who impute their might unto their god.
Argumentative:O LORD, Thou hast ordained them for judgment, and Thou, O Rock, hast established them for correction.
Argumentative:13 Thou that art of eyes too pure to behold evil, and that canst not look on mischief, wherefore lookest Thou, when they deal treacherously, and holdest Thy peace, when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; 14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
Argumentative:15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag; therefore they rejoice and exult.
Argumentative:16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and offer unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plenteous.
Argumentative:17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?
Argumentative:Habakkuk2 1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look out to see what He will speak by me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
Argumentative:' 4 Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.
Argumentative:5 Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer; the haughty man abideth not; he who enlargeth his desire as the nether-world, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.
Argumentative:and that ladeth himself with many pledges!
Argumentative:8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Argumentative:9 Woe to him that gaineth evil gains for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
Argumentative:10 Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast forfeited thy life.
Argumentative:4 Therefore the law is slacked, and right doth never go forth; for the wicked doth beset the righteous; therefore right goeth forth perverted.
Argumentative:11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
Argumentative:12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!
Argumentative:13 Behold, is it not of HaShem of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
Argumentative:15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy venom thereto, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
Argumentative:17 For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Argumentative:' Can this teach?
Argumentative:so that there is strife, and contention ariseth.
Argumentative:Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
Argumentative:Habakkuk3 1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet.
Argumentative:His glory covereth the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise.
Argumentative:5 Before him goeth the pestilence, and fiery bolts go forth at His feet.
Argumentative:6 He standeth, and shaketh the earth, He beholdeth, and maketh the nations to tremble; and the everlasting mountains are dashed in pieces, the ancient hills do bow; His goings are as of old.
Argumentative:7 I see the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian do tremble.
Argumentative:9 Thy bow is made quite bare; sworn are the rods of the word.
Argumentative:10 The mountains have seen Thee, and they tremble; the tempest of waters floweth over; the deep uttereth its voice, and lifteth up its hands on high.
Argumentative:12 Thou marchest through the earth in indignation, Thou threshest the nations in anger.
Argumentative:14 Thou hast stricken through with his own rods the head of his rulers, that come as a whirlwind to scatter me; whose rejoicing is as to devour the poor secretly.
Argumentative:17 For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; 18 Yet I will rejoice in HaShem, I will exult in the G-d of my salvation.
Argumentative:19 G-d, HaShem, is my strength, and He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and He maketh me to walk upon my high places.

Argumentative:4 And HaShem said unto him: 'Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
Argumentative:' 4 For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim; 5 afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek HaShem their G-d, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto HaShem and to His goodness in the end of days. Hosea4 1 Hear the word of HaShem, ye children of Israel!
Argumentative:for HaShem hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of G-d in the land.
Argumentative:2 Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery!
Argumentative:they break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood.
Argumentative:3 Therefore doth the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, with the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away.
Argumentative:4 Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
Argumentative:5 Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
Argumentative:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy G-d, I also will forget thy children.
Argumentative:7 The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
Argumentative:8 They feed on the sin of My people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
Argumentative:9 And it is like people, like priest; and I will punish him for his ways, and will recompense him his doings.
Argumentative:10 And they shall eat, and not have enough, they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; because they have left off to take heed to HaShem.
Argumentative:12 My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their G-d. 13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and offer upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit harlotry, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
Argumentative:14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for they themselves consort with lewd women, and they sacrifice with harlots; and the people that is without understanding is distraught.
Argumentative:' 16 For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; now shall HaShem feed them as a lamb in a large place?
Argumentative:17 Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
Argumentative:18 When their carouse is over, they take to harlotry; her rulers deeply love dishonour.
Argumentative:19 The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
Argumentative:2 And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; and I am rejected of them all.
Argumentative:3 I, even I, know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled.
Argumentative:4 Their doings will not suffer them to return unto their G-d; for the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not HaShem.
Argumentative:5 But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them.
Argumentative:6 With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek HaShem, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them.
Argumentative:10 The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.
Argumentative:11 Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; because he willingly walked after filth.
Argumentative:13 And when Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Contentious; but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound.
Argumentative:15 I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their trouble they will seek Me earnestly: Hosea6 1 'Come, and let us return unto HaShem; for He hath torn, and He will heal us, He hath smitten, and He will bind us up.
Argumentative:3 And let us know, eagerly strive to know HaShem, His going forth is sure as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.
Argumentative:for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.
Argumentative:7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against Me.
Argumentative:8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is covered with footprints of blood.
Argumentative:9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so doth the company of priests; they murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they commit enormity.
Argumentative:10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; there harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
Argumentative:When I would turn the captivity of My people, Hosea7 1 when I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.
Argumentative:2 And let them not say to their heart--I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about, they are before My face.
Argumentative:3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
Argumentative:4 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth to stir from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.
Argumentative:5 On the day of our king the princes make him sick with the heat of wine, he stretcheth out his hand with scorners.
Argumentative:6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
Argumentative:7 They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me.
Argumentative:8 Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned.
Argumentative:9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.
Argumentative:for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them!
Argumentative:for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, seeing they have spoken lies against Me?
Argumentative:14 And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, though they wail upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.
Argumentative:16 They return, but not upwards; they are become like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
Argumentative:Hosea8 1 Set the horn to thy mouth.
Argumentative:As a vulture he cometh against the house of HaShem; because they have transgressed My covenant, and trespassed against My law.
Argumentative:3 Israel hath cast off that which is good; the enemy shall pursue him.
Argumentative:4 They have set up kings, but not from Me, they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
Argumentative:5 Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; Mine anger is kindled against them; how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
Argumentative:7 For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; it hath no stalk, the bud that shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
Argumentative:8 Israel is swallowed up; now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no value.
Argumentative:9 For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath hired lovers.
Argumentative:12 Though I write for him never so many things of My Law, they are accounted as a stranger's.
Argumentative:13 As for the sacrifices that are made by fire unto Me, let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, for HaShem accepteth them not.
Argumentative:Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
Argumentative:Hosea9 1 Rejoice not, O Israel, unto exultation, like the peoples, for thou hast gone astray from thy G-d, thou hast loved a harlot's hire upon every corn-floor.
Argumentative:2 The threshing-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.
Argumentative:3 They shall not dwell in HaShem'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
Argumentative:4 They shall not pour out wine-offerings to HaShem, neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite, it shall not come into the house of HaShem.
Argumentative:6 For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their precious treasures of silver, nettles shall possess them, thorns shall be in their tents.
Argumentative:7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it.
Argumentative:The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad!
Argumentative:8 Ephraim is a watchman with my G-d; as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his G-d. 9 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.
Argumentative:11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird; there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.
Argumentative:14 Give them, O LORD, whatsoever Thou wilt give; give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
Argumentative:15 All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I hated them; because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house; I will love them no more, all their princes are rebellious.
Argumentative:16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.
Argumentative:17 My G-d will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
Argumentative:Hosea10 1 Israel was a luxuriant vine, which put forth fruit freely: as his fruit increased, he increased his altars; the more goodly his land was, the more goodly were his pillars.
Argumentative:2 Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt; He will break down their altars, He will spoil their pillars.
Argumentative:' 4 They speak words, they swear falsely, they make covenants; thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
Argumentative:5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it.
Argumentative:6 It also shall be carried unto Assyria, for a present to King Contentious; Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
Argumentative:' 9 From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel; there they stood; no battle was to overtake them in Gibeah, nor the children of arrogancy.
Argumentative:10 When it is My desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are yoked to their two rings.
Argumentative:11 And Ephraim is a heifer well broken, that loveth to thresh, and I have passed over upon her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.
Argumentative:12 Sow to yourselves according to righteousness, reap according to mercy, break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek HaShem, till He come and cause righteousness to rain upon you.
Argumentative:13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
Argumentative:14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy hosts, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
Argumentative:15 So hath Beth-el done unto you because of your great wickedness; at daybreak is the king of Israel utterly cut off.
Argumentative:2 The more they called them, the more they went from them; they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and offered to graven images.
Argumentative:5 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
Argumentative:6 And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
Argumentative:7 And My people are in suspense about returning to Me; and though they call them upwards, none at all will lift himself up.
Argumentative:10 They shall walk after HaShem, who shall roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
Argumentative:He loveth to oppress.
Argumentative:Hosea13 1 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he became guilty through Baal, he died.
Argumentative:2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, according to their own understanding, even idols, all of them the work of the craftsmen; of them they say: 'They that sacrifice men kiss calves.
Argumentative:' 3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the wind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the window.
Argumentative:5 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
Argumentative:6 When they were fed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten Me.
Argumentative:9 It is thy destruction, O Israel, that thou art against Me, against thy help.
Argumentative:and thy judges, of whom thou saidst: 'Give me a king and princes!
Argumentative:13 The throes of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children.
Argumentative:14 Shall I ransom them from the power of the nether-world?
Argumentative:Ho, thy plagues, O death!
Argumentative:Ho, thy destruction, O netherworld!
Argumentative:15 For though he be fruitful among the reed-plants, an east wind shall come, the wind of HaShem coming up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; he shall spoil the treasure of all precious vessels.
Argumentative:For the ways of HaShem are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein.

Argumentative:11 If they say: 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause; 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit; 13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil; 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse'-- 15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path; 16 For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
Argumentative:17 For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird; 18 And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives.
Argumentative:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Argumentative:And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Argumentative:29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of HaShem; 30 They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof.

Argumentative:32 For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them.
Argumentative:' Proverbs2 1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee; 2 So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, and thy heart incline to discernment; 3 Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment; 4 If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of HaShem, and find the knowledge of G-d. 6 For HaShem giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment; 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity; 8 That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones.
Argumentative:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path.

Argumentative:12 A base person, a man of iniquity, is he that walketh with a froward mouth; 13 That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, that pointeth with his fingers; 14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord.
Argumentative:16 There are six things which HaShem hateth, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him: 17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; 18 A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil; 19 A false witness that breatheth out lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
Argumentative:20 My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother; 21 Bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck.
Argumentative:22 When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Argumentative:23 For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life; 24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the smoothness of the alien tongue.
Argumentative:26 For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, but the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
Argumentative:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

Argumentative:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox that goeth to the slaughter, or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool; 23 Till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteneth to the snare-- and knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life.

Argumentative:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice; 21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.
Argumentative:22 HaShem made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old.
Argumentative:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Argumentative:27 When He established the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep, 28 When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep showed their might, 29 When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He appointed the foundations of the earth; 30 Then I was by Him, as a nursling; and I was daily all delight, playing always before Him, 31 Playing in His habitable earth, and my delights are with the sons of men.
Argumentative:32 Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; for happy are they that keep my ways.
Argumentative:34 Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
Argumentative:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of HaShem.

Argumentative:6 Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.
Argumentative:7 He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, and he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.

Argumentative:9 Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

Argumentative:6 Thou art HaShem, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee.
Argumentative:7 Thou art HaShem the G-d, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 8 and foundest his heart faithful before Thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed Thy words; for Thou art righteous; 9 And Thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; 10 and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get Thee a name, as it is this day.
Argumentative:11 And Thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers Thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.
Argumentative:18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said: 'This is thy G-d that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 19 yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
Argumentative:20 Thou gavest also Thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.

Argumentative:25 And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance; so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and luxuriated in Thy great goodness.
Argumentative:27 Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto Thee, Thou heardest from heaven; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them saviours who might save them out of the hand of their adversaries.
Argumentative:35 For they have not served Thee in their kingdom, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
Argumentative:36 Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.
Argumentative:37 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.

Argumentative:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.

Argumentative:23 Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant in their lives, even in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
Argumentative:Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!
Argumentative:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; wonderful was thy love to me, passing the love of women.

Argumentative:7 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner: 'Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?

Argumentative:9 G-d do so to Abner, and more also, if, as HaShem hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; 10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.

Argumentative:2 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and HaShem said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
Argumentative:' 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before HaShem; and they anointed David king over Israel.
Argumentative:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: 'Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither'; thinking: 'David cannot come in hither.
Argumentative:8 And David said on that day: 'Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and taketh away the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul--.
Argumentative:' Wherefore they say: 'There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.
Argumentative:' 9 And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
Argumentative:10 And David waxed greater and greater; for HaShem, the G-d of hosts, was with him.
Argumentative:12 And David perceived that HaShem had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake.
Argumentative:17 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
Argumentative:18 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
Argumentative:' And HaShem said unto David: 'Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
Argumentative:' 20 And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: 'HaShem hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
Argumentative:' Therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim.
Argumentative:24 And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is HaShem gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
Argumentative:5 And David and all the house of Israel played before HaShem with all manner of instruments made of cypress-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals.
Argumentative:11 And the ark of HaShem remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and HaShem blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
Argumentative:12 And it was told king David, saying: 'HaShem hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of G-d.' And David went and brought up the ark of G-d from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
Argumentative:17 And they brought in the ark of HaShem, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before HaShem.
Argumentative:18 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of HaShem of hosts.
Argumentative:19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake.
Argumentative:' 21 And David said unto Michal: 'Before HaShem, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of HaShem, over Israel, before HaShem will I make merry.
Argumentative:22 And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of, with them will I get me honour.
Argumentative:2_Samuel7 1 And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and HaShem had given him rest from all his enemies round about, 2 that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: 'See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of G-d dwelleth within curtains.
Argumentative:9 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
Argumentative:10 And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 11 even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies.
Argumentative:Moreover HaShem telleth thee that HaShem will make thee a house.
Argumentative:12 When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom.
Argumentative:13 He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
Argumentative:' 17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
Argumentative:for Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord G-D. 21 For Thy word's sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it.
Argumentative:22 Therefore Thou art great, O LORD G-d; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any G-d beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
Argumentative:23 And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom G-d went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, in driving out from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods?
Argumentative:' 2_Samuel8 1 And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
Argumentative:And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents.
Argumentative:5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men.
Argumentative:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
Argumentative:9 And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 10 then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him--because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi--and he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass.
Argumentative:13 And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
Argumentative:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
Argumentative:2_Samuel9 1 And David said: 'Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
Argumentative:' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame on his feet.
Argumentative:And David said: 'Mephibosheth!
Argumentative:' And he answered: 'Behold thy servant!
Argumentative:' 7 And David said unto him: 'Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
Argumentative:' 9 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him: 'All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son.
Argumentative:10 And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread continually at my table.
Argumentative:' 12 Now Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
Argumentative:2 And David said: 'I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me.
Argumentative:' So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
Argumentative:And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
Argumentative:hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
Argumentative:' 4 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
Argumentative:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed.
Argumentative:' 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob, and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
Argumentative:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
Argumentative:9 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans; 10 and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
Argumentative:12 Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our G-d; and HaShem do that which seemeth Him good.
Argumentative:' 13 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Arameans; and they fled before him.
Argumentative:14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city.
Argumentative:15 And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
Argumentative:18 And the Arameans fled before Israel; and David slew of the Arameans seven hundred drivers of chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.
Argumentative:19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.
Argumentative:So the Arameans feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
Argumentative:2 And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
Argumentative:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
Argumentative:10 And when they had told David, saying: 'Uriah went not down unto his house', David said unto Uriah: 'Art thou not come from a journey?
Argumentative:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 19 and he charged the messenger, saying: 'When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, 20 it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee: Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight?
Argumentative:knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
Argumentative:why went ye so nigh the wall?
Argumentative:24 And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
Argumentative:27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.
Argumentative:But the thing that David had done displeased HaShem.
Argumentative:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; 3 but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared; and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
Argumentative:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
Argumentative:' 5 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan: 'As HaShem liveth, the man that hath done this deserveth to die; 6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
Argumentative:' 7 And Nathan said to David: 'Thou art the man.
Argumentative:Thus saith HaShem, the G-d of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 8 and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that were too little, then would I add unto thee so much more.
Argumentative:11 Thus saith HaShem: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
